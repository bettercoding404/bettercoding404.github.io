## Fundamental Concepts

### Greedy Algorithms
A greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. It is often used for problems where making the best immediate choice leads to the best overall solution. For example, in the coin - change problem, if you want to make change for a certain amount using the fewest number of coins, a greedy algorithm would always pick the largest coin denomination possible at each step.

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub - problems and storing the solutions to these sub - problems to avoid redundant calculations. It is useful for problems with overlapping sub - problems and optimal substructure. For instance, the Fibonacci sequence calculation can be optimized using dynamic programming.

### Divide and Conquer
The divide - and - conquer strategy involves breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable sub - problems, solving each sub - problem independently, and then combining the solutions of the sub - problems to solve the original problem. Examples include the merge sort and quicksort algorithms.

## Usage Methods

### Implementing Greedy Algorithms
```python
# Coin change problem using greedy algorithm
def coin_change(amount, coins):
    coins.sort(reverse=True)
    num_coins = 0
    for coin in coins:
        while amount >= coin:
            amount -= coin
            num_coins += 1
    return num_coins


amount = 63
coins = [25, 10, 5, 1]
print(coin_change(amount, coins))
```
In this code, we first sort the coin denominations in descending order. Then, we repeatedly subtract the largest coin denomination possible from the remaining amount until the amount becomes zero.

### Using Dynamic Programming
```python
# Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]


n = 10
print(fibonacci(n))
```
Here, we create an array `dp` to store the Fibonacci numbers. We first initialize the base cases and then calculate the subsequent Fibonacci numbers using the previously calculated values.

### Applying Divide and Conquer
```python
# Merge sort algorithm
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)


def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result


arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
print(merge_sort(arr))
```
In merge sort, we divide the array into two halves, recursively sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves.

## Common Practices

### Algorithm Selection
- Analyze the problem requirements carefully. If the problem has a greedy property (making the best local choice leads to the best global solution), a greedy algorithm may be appropriate.
- Look for overlapping sub - problems and optimal substructure. If these characteristics are present, dynamic programming can be a good choice.
- For problems that can be easily divided into smaller sub - problems, the divide - and - conquer approach is suitable.

### Code Optimization
- Use built - in Python functions and libraries whenever possible. For example, instead of implementing sorting algorithms from scratch, use the `sorted()` function.
- Minimize unnecessary calculations and avoid redundant code.

### Testing and Debugging
- Write test cases for different input scenarios. This helps in identifying bugs early in the development process.
- Use Python's debugging tools like `pdb` to step through the code and find the source of errors.

## Best Practices

### Time Management
- Allocate specific time slots for problem analysis, algorithm design, coding, testing, and debugging.
- Don't get stuck on a single problem for too long. If you're unable to solve a problem, move on and come back to it later.

### Teamwork
- Communicate effectively with your team members. Share ideas, divide tasks, and collaborate on code development.
- Review each other's code to catch errors and improve the overall quality of the solution.

### Documentation
- Add comments to your code to explain the purpose of different functions and sections.
- Write a README file that describes the problem, the algorithm used, and how to run the code.

## Conclusion
In Python hackathons, advanced algorithm strategies like greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and divide - and - conquer can significantly enhance your problem - solving capabilities. By understanding the fundamental concepts, knowing how to use these strategies, following common practices, and adhering to best practices, you can increase your chances of success in a hackathon. Remember to practice these algorithms regularly to become more proficient in using them under pressure.
