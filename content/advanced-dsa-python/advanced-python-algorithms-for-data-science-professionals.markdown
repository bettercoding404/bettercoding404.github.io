## Fundamental Concepts

### Algorithm Complexity
Algorithm complexity is a measure of how the running time or space requirements of an algorithm grow with the size of the input. In data science, we often deal with large datasets, so understanding complexity is crucial.

- **Time Complexity**: It describes how the running time of an algorithm changes as the input size increases. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n)$ means that the running time is linearly proportional to the size of the input $n$.
- **Space Complexity**: It refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires as a function of the input size.

### Divide and Conquer
The divide - and - conquer strategy involves breaking a large problem into smaller sub - problems, solving each sub - problem independently, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem. Merge sort is a classic example of a divide - and - conquer algorithm.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result

arr = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)
```

### Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. For example, in the coin - change problem, if we want to make change for a certain amount using the fewest number of coins, a greedy algorithm would always pick the largest coin denomination possible at each step.

```python
def coin_change(amount, coins):
    coins.sort(reverse=True)
    count = 0
    for coin in coins:
        while amount >= coin:
            amount -= coin
            count += 1
    return count

amount = 63
coins = [25, 10, 5, 1]
print(coin_change(amount, coins))
```

## Usage Methods

### Searching and Sorting
Searching and sorting algorithms are fundamental in data science for tasks such as data exploration and preprocessing.

- **Binary Search**: It is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a sorted array. The time complexity of binary search is $O(log n)$.
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]
target = 10
print(binary_search(arr, target))
```

### Graph Algorithms
Graph algorithms are used in many data science applications, such as social network analysis and recommendation systems.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: It is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non - negative edge weights.
```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]

    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}
start_node = 'A'
print(dijkstra(graph, start_node))
```

## Common Practices

### Using Built - in Libraries
Python has many built - in libraries that implement advanced algorithms efficiently. For example, the `sorted()` function in Python uses a highly optimized sorting algorithm (Timsort) with a time complexity of $O(n log n)$.

```python
arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
print(sorted_arr)
```

### Algorithm Selection
Selecting the right algorithm for a given problem is crucial. Consider the size of the input, the nature of the problem, and the available resources. For example, if you have a small dataset, a simple sorting algorithm like bubble sort might be sufficient, but for large datasets, more efficient algorithms like quicksort or mergesort are preferred.

## Best Practices

### Code Readability
Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable names and add comments to explain the logic of the algorithm.

```python
# Function to calculate the factorial of a number
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

num = 5
print(factorial(num))
```

### Testing and Optimization
Test your algorithms thoroughly with different input sizes and edge cases. Profile your code to identify bottlenecks and optimize it if necessary.

```python
import timeit

code_to_test = """
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

factorial(5)
"""

execution_time = timeit.timeit(code_to_test, number = 10000)
print(execution_time)
```

## Conclusion
Advanced Python algorithms are essential tools for data science professionals. By understanding fundamental concepts, knowing how to use different algorithms, following common practices, and adhering to best practices, data scientists can solve complex data - related problems more efficiently. Whether it's sorting large datasets, finding shortest paths in graphs, or making optimal decisions, these algorithms provide the necessary foundation for success in data science.
