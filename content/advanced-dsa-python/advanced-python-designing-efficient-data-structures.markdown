## Fundamental Concepts
### Efficiency Metrics
When designing data structures, we often consider two main efficiency metrics: time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity measures how the running time of an operation on the data structure grows with the size of the input. Space complexity measures the amount of memory the data structure uses as a function of the input size.

### Abstraction and Encapsulation
Abstraction allows us to represent complex data structures in a simplified way, hiding the implementation details. Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of the data structure is protected from external interference, and access to the data is controlled through well - defined methods.

## Built - in Data Structures
### Lists
Lists in Python are dynamic arrays. They are mutable, which means we can change their contents after creation.
```python
# Creating a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Adding an element
my_list.append(6)

# Accessing an element
print(my_list[2])
```
The time complexity of appending an element to the end of a list is O(1) on average, while accessing an element by index is also O(1).

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are hash tables in Python. They store key - value pairs.
```python
# Creating a dictionary
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}

# Accessing a value
print(my_dict['name'])

# Adding a new key - value pair
my_dict['city'] = 'New York'
```
The time complexity of accessing, inserting, or deleting a key - value pair in a dictionary is O(1) on average.

### Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
```python
# Creating a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Adding an element
my_set.add(6)

# Checking if an element exists
print(3 in my_set)
```
The time complexity of adding an element to a set and checking if an element exists in a set is O(1) on average.

## Custom Data Structures
### Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a node. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the list.
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node

    def display(self):
        elements = []
        current_node = self.head
        while current_node:
            elements.append(current_node.data)
            current_node = current_node.next
        print(elements)


llist = LinkedList()
llist.append(1)
llist.append(2)
llist.append(3)
llist.display()
```
The time complexity of appending an element to the end of a singly linked list is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

### Stacks
A stack is a Last - In - First - Out (LIFO) data structure. We can implement a stack using a list in Python.
```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]


stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())
```
The time complexity of pushing and popping an element from a stack implemented using a list is O(1).

## Usage Methods
### Iteration
We can iterate over data structures in Python using loops.
```python
# Iterating over a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for element in my_list:
    print(element)

# Iterating over a dictionary
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```

### Filtering and Mapping
We can use functions like `filter()` and `map()` to manipulate data structures.
```python
# Filtering a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, my_list))
print(even_numbers)

# Mapping a list
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, my_list))
print(squared_numbers)
```

## Common Practices
### Choosing the Right Data Structure
Based on the requirements of our program, we should choose the most appropriate data structure. For example, if we need to store unique elements and perform membership tests frequently, a set is a good choice. If we need to store key - value pairs and access values by keys quickly, a dictionary is the way to go.

### Using Generators
Generators are a memory - efficient way to iterate over large data sets. Instead of creating a list all at once, a generator produces values on - the - fly.
```python
# Generator function
def square_numbers(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i ** 2


gen = square_numbers(5)
for num in gen:
    print(num)
```

## Best Practices
### Avoid Unnecessary Copies
Making unnecessary copies of data structures can waste memory and time. For example, when passing a list to a function, if the function doesn't need to modify the original list, we can pass it as an immutable view.

### Optimize Memory Usage
For large data sets, we should try to use data structures that consume less memory. For example, using a `tuple` instead of a `list` when the data is immutable can save memory.

## Conclusion
Designing efficient data structures is crucial for writing high - performance Python code. By understanding the fundamental concepts, using built - in and custom data structures effectively, and following common and best practices, we can optimize the time and space complexity of our programs. Whether you are working on a small script or a large - scale application, choosing the right data structure can make a significant difference in the performance of your code.
