## Fundamental Concepts

### Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. In the context of DSA, it is used to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n)$ means that the running time of the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input `n`.

```python
# Example of O(n) algorithm: Summing elements in a list
def sum_list(lst):
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        total += num
    return total

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_list(my_list))
```

### Data Structures
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently. Python has several built - in data structures such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. For advanced optimization, custom data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs can also be implemented.

### Algorithms
Algorithms are step - by - step procedures for solving a problem. Different algorithms have different time and space complexities. For example, the bubble sort algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, while the merge sort algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n log n)$.

## Usage Methods

### Using Built - in Data Structures
Python's built - in data structures are optimized for common use cases. For example, sets are useful for membership testing as they have an average time complexity of $O(1)$ for this operation.

```python
# Using a set for membership testing
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
if 3 in my_set:
    print("3 is in the set")
```

### Implementing Custom Data Structures
For more complex problems, custom data structures may be required. Here is an example of implementing a simple singly linked list in Python.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node


llist = LinkedList()
llist.append(1)
llist.append(2)
llist.append(3)
```

### Algorithm Selection
The choice of algorithm depends on the problem at hand. For sorting a large list, an algorithm like quicksort or mergesort is more efficient than bubble sort.

```python
import random

my_list = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]
sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
print(sorted_list)
```

## Common Practices

### Sorting Optimization
When sorting data, using Python's built - in `sorted()` function is usually the best option as it is implemented using an optimized sorting algorithm (Timsort).

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
sorted_fruits = sorted(fruits)
print(sorted_fruits)
```

### Searching Optimization
For searching in a sorted list, binary search is more efficient than linear search. Here is an example of binary search implementation.

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

sorted_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = binary_search(sorted_arr, 3)
print(result)
```

### Memory Management
In Python, memory management is mostly handled by the garbage collector. However, for large data sets, it is important to release memory when it is no longer needed. For example, deleting large lists or dictionaries.

```python
large_list = [i for i in range(1000000)]
# Use the list
del large_list
```

## Best Practices

### Code Readability and Maintainability
Even when optimizing code, it is important to keep the code readable and maintainable. Use meaningful variable names and add comments to explain complex parts of the code.

```python
# Calculate the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n
def sum_of_squares(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += i**2
    return total
```

### Testing and Profiling
Before and after optimization, test the code to ensure that it still works correctly. Profiling tools like `cProfile` can be used to identify performance bottlenecks.

```python
import cProfile

def some_function():
    lst = [i for i in range(1000000)]
    total = sum(lst)
    return total

cProfile.run('some_function()')
```

## Conclusion
Code optimization using advanced DSA techniques in Python is a powerful way to improve the performance of your applications. By understanding fundamental concepts like Big O notation, using appropriate data structures and algorithms, following common practices, and adhering to best practices, you can write more efficient and maintainable code. Remember that optimization should be done with care, as it can sometimes make the code more complex.
