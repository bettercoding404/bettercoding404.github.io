## 1. Fundamental Concepts of Computational Efficiency

### Time Complexity
Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of the input. It is usually expressed using Big - O notation. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n)$ means that the running time grows linearly with the size of the input $n$. 

```python
# Example of O(n) time complexity
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
print(linear_search(arr, target))
```

### Space Complexity
Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the size of the input. An algorithm with a space complexity of $O(1)$ uses a constant amount of memory regardless of the input size.

```python
# Example of O(1) space complexity
def sum_of_numbers(n):
    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2

n = 10
print(sum_of_numbers(n))
```


## 2. Advanced Python Algorithms for Efficiency

### Divide and Conquer
The divide - and - conquer strategy involves breaking a problem into smaller sub - problems, solving them independently, and then combining the solutions. Merge sort is a classic example of a divide - and - conquer algorithm.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result

arr = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
print(merge_sort(arr))
```

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is used to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping sub - problems and storing the solutions of sub - problems to avoid redundant calculations. The Fibonacci sequence calculation can be optimized using dynamic programming.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]

n = 10
print(fibonacci(n))
```


## 3. Usage Methods

### Profiling
Python provides tools like `cProfile` to measure the running time of different parts of a program.

```python
import cProfile

def some_function():
    result = 0
    for i in range(1000000):
        result += i
    return result

cProfile.run('some_function()')
```

### Using Built - in Data Structures Efficiently
Python's built - in data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets have different performance characteristics. For example, searching in a dictionary has an average time complexity of $O(1)$, which is much faster than searching in a list ($O(n)$).

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_dict = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'four', 5: 'five'}

target = 3
# Searching in a list
if target in my_list:
    print("Found in list")
# Searching in a dictionary
if target in my_dict:
    print("Found in dictionary")
```


## 4. Common Practices

### Avoiding Nested Loops
Nested loops can significantly increase the time complexity of an algorithm. Try to find alternative ways to solve the problem. For example, instead of using two nested loops to find pairs of elements in a list, use a single loop and a data structure like a dictionary.

```python
# Bad example with nested loops
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
pairs = []
for i in range(len(arr)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
        pairs.append((arr[i], arr[j]))
print(pairs)

# A better approach using itertools
import itertools
pairs = list(itertools.combinations(arr, 2))
print(pairs)
```

### Reusing Results
If you have calculated a value that will be used multiple times, store it in a variable instead of recalculating it.


## 5. Best Practices

### Code Optimization
Use Python's built - in functions and libraries whenever possible, as they are often implemented in highly optimized C or other low - level languages. For example, use `sum()` instead of writing your own loop to calculate the sum of a list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Using built - in sum function
total = sum(my_list)
print(total)
```

### Algorithm Selection
Choose the right algorithm for the problem. Consider the time and space complexity of different algorithms and select the one that best suits your requirements.


## 6. Conclusion
Computational efficiency is a vital aspect of programming, and Python offers a wide range of advanced algorithms and techniques to optimize it. By understanding fundamental concepts like time and space complexity, using advanced algorithms such as divide - and - conquer and dynamic programming, and following best practices like code optimization and proper algorithm selection, developers can write more efficient Python code. Profiling and using built - in data structures efficiently are also key steps in improving computational efficiency.
