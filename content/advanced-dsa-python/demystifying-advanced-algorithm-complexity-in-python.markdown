## Fundamental Concepts

### Big - O Notation
Big - O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity. It gives an asymptotic upper bound on how the running time or space requirements of an algorithm grow with the size of the input.

For example, consider a simple Python function to find the sum of a list of numbers:

```python
def sum_list(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total


```
The time complexity of this function is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the `numbers` list. This is because the loop runs once for each element in the list.

### Omega and Theta Notations
- **Omega Notation ($\Omega$)**: It represents the lower bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity. An algorithm has a time complexity of $\Omega(g(n))$ if there exists a positive constant $c$ and a non - negative integer $n_0$ such that $T(n)\geq c\cdot g(n)$ for all $n\geq n_0$, where $T(n)$ is the running time of the algorithm.
- **Theta Notation ($\Theta$)**: It represents both the upper and lower bounds of an algorithm's time or space complexity. An algorithm has a time complexity of $\Theta(g(n))$ if it has both $O(g(n))$ and $\Omega(g(n))$ complexity.

## Measuring Complexity in Python

### Using Timeit Module
The `timeit` module in Python can be used to measure the execution time of small code snippets.

```python
import timeit

code = '''
numbers = list(range(1000))
total = 0
for num in numbers:
    total += num
'''

execution_time = timeit.timeit(code, number = 1000)
print(f"Execution time: {execution_time} seconds")


```

### Profiling with cProfile
The `cProfile` module provides deterministic profiling of Python programs. It gives detailed information about the number of function calls, the time spent in each function, etc.

```python
import cProfile


def sum_list(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total


numbers = list(range(10000))
cProfile.run('sum_list(numbers)')


```

## Common Algorithms and Their Complexities

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr


```
The time complexity of bubble sort is $O(n^2)$ in the average and worst cases.

- **Merge Sort**:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)


def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result


```
The time complexity of merge sort is $O(n\log n)$ in all cases.

### Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search**:
```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1


```
The time complexity of linear search is $O(n)$.

- **Binary Search**:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1


```
The time complexity of binary search is $O(\log n)$ for a sorted array.

## Best Practices for Reducing Complexity

### Algorithm Selection
Choose the right algorithm for the problem. For example, if you need to sort a large list, use an $O(n\log n)$ sorting algorithm like merge sort or quicksort instead of a $O(n^2)$ algorithm like bubble sort.

### Data Structure Optimization
Use appropriate data structures. For example, if you need to perform frequent lookups, use a dictionary in Python which has an average $O(1)$ lookup time, instead of a list which has a $O(n)$ lookup time.

```python
# Using a list for lookup
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
if 3 in my_list:
    print("Found in list")

# Using a dictionary for lookup
my_dict = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'd', 5: 'e'}
if 3 in my_dict:
    print("Found in dictionary")


```

## Conclusion
Understanding advanced algorithm complexity in Python is crucial for writing efficient code. By mastering fundamental concepts like Big - O, Omega, and Theta notations, and learning how to measure complexity using tools like `timeit` and `cProfile`, developers can make informed decisions about algorithm selection and data structure usage. By following best practices, such as choosing the right algorithm and optimizing data structures, developers can significantly reduce the time and space complexity of their Python programs.
