## Stacks
### Fundamental Concepts
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Think of a stack of books; the book you place on top last is the first one you can pick up.

### Usage Methods
In Python, we can implement a stack using a list. Here are the basic operations:
- `push`: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- `pop`: Remove and return the top element from the stack.
- `peek`: Return the top element without removing it.
- `is_empty`: Check if the stack is empty.

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        return None

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

# Example usage
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
print(stack.peek())  # Output: 2
```

### Common Practices
- Use stacks to implement algorithms such as expression evaluation, backtracking, and depth-first search.
- When dealing with recursive algorithms, stacks can be used to simulate the call stack.

### Best Practices
- Always check if the stack is empty before performing a `pop` or `peek` operation to avoid errors.
- Use a proper naming convention for stack operations to make your code more readable.

## Queues
### Fundamental Concepts
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Think of a line of people waiting for a bus; the person who arrives first gets on the bus first.

### Usage Methods
In Python, we can implement a queue using the `collections.deque` class, which provides efficient queue operations. Here are the basic operations:
- `enqueue`: Add an element to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue`: Remove and return the first element from the queue.
- `is_empty`: Check if the queue is empty.

```python
from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = deque()

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.popleft()
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

# Example usage
queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
queue.enqueue(3)
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 1
```

### Common Practices
- Use queues to implement algorithms such as breadth-first search, task scheduling, and event handling.
- Queues are useful for managing resources in a first-come, first-served manner.

### Best Practices
- Use the `collections.deque` class instead of a list for better performance, especially when dealing with large queues.
- Always check if the queue is empty before performing a `dequeue` operation to avoid errors.

## Linked Lists
### Fundamental Concepts
A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element, called a node, contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. Linked lists can be singly linked (each node has a reference to the next node) or doubly linked (each node has references to both the next and previous nodes).

### Usage Methods
Here is an implementation of a singly linked list in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node

    def display(self):
        elements = []
        current = self.head
        while current:
            elements.append(str(current.value))
            current = current.next
        print(" -> ".join(elements))

# Example usage
linked_list = LinkedList()
linked_list.append(1)
linked_list.append(2)
linked_list.append(3)
linked_list.display()  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3
```

### Common Practices
- Use linked lists when you need to insert or delete elements at the beginning or middle of a list efficiently.
- Linked lists are commonly used in implementing data structures such as stacks and queues.

### Best Practices
- Keep track of the head and tail nodes of the linked list for efficient insertion and deletion operations.
- When traversing a linked list, always check if the current node is `None` to avoid errors.

## Trees
### Fundamental Concepts
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node can have zero or more child nodes, except for the root node, which has no parent. Trees are commonly used in computer science for tasks such as data storage, searching, and sorting.

### Usage Methods
Here is an implementation of a binary tree in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

# Example usage
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
```

### Common Practices
- Use trees to implement algorithms such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and heap trees.
- Trees are useful for representing hierarchical relationships, such as file systems and organizational charts.

### Best Practices
- When implementing tree algorithms, use recursion to simplify the code and improve readability.
- Keep track of the height and balance of the tree to ensure efficient operations.

## Graphs
### Fundamental Concepts
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a set of vertices (nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs can be directed (edges have a direction) or undirected (edges have no direction). Graphs are used to model relationships between objects, such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks.

### Usage Methods
Here is an implementation of a graph using an adjacency list in Python:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.adj_list = {}

    def add_vertex(self, vertex):
        if vertex not in self.adj_list:
            self.adj_list[vertex] = []

    def add_edge(self, vertex1, vertex2):
        if vertex1 in self.adj_list and vertex2 in self.adj_list:
            self.adj_list[vertex1].append(vertex2)
            self.adj_list[vertex2].append(vertex1)

# Example usage
graph = Graph()
graph.add_vertex(1)
graph.add_vertex(2)
graph.add_edge(1, 2)
print(graph.adj_list)  # Output: {1: [2], 2: [1]}
```

### Common Practices
- Use graphs to implement algorithms such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and Prim's algorithm.
- Graphs are useful for solving problems such as finding the shortest path, detecting cycles, and finding connected components.

### Best Practices
- Use an appropriate data structure (e.g., adjacency list or adjacency matrix) to represent the graph based on the problem requirements.
- When implementing graph algorithms, use proper data structures (e.g., queues or stacks) to manage the traversal process.
