## Sorting Algorithms

### Merge Sort
#### Fundamental Concept
Merge sort is a divide - and - conquer algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into n sub - lists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). Then it repeatedly merges sub - lists to produce new sorted sub - lists until there is only one sub - list remaining.

#### Usage Method
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = arr[:mid]
    right_half = arr[mid:]

    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)

    return merge(left_half, right_half)


def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0

    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1

    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result


arr = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)
```
#### Common Practice
Merge sort is often used when a stable sorting algorithm is required. A stable sort maintains the relative order of elements with equal values.

#### Best Practice
When dealing with large datasets, using the built - in `sorted()` function in Python is more efficient as it is implemented in highly optimized C code.

### Quick Sort
#### Fundamental Concept
Quick sort is also a divide - and - conquer algorithm. It selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub - arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub - arrays are then sorted recursively.

#### Usage Method
```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    else:
        pivot = arr[0]
        less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]
        greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]
        return quick_sort(less)+[pivot]+quick_sort(greater)


arr = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)
```
#### Common Practice
Quick sort is widely used in practice because of its average case time complexity of $O(n log n)$.

#### Best Practice
Randomly selecting the pivot can avoid the worst - case scenario (when the array is already sorted) and improve the algorithm's performance.


## Searching Algorithms

### Binary Search
#### Fundamental Concept
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

#### Usage Method
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1


arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]
target = 10
result = binary_search(arr, target)
if result != -1:
    print(f"Element found at index {result}")
else:
    print("Element not found")
```
#### Common Practice
Binary search is used when you need to search for an element in a large sorted dataset, such as in a database index.

#### Best Practice
Make sure the input array is sorted before applying binary search. Otherwise, the algorithm will not work correctly.


## Graph Algorithms

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
#### Fundamental Concept
Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non - negative edge weights. It starts at a given source node and explores the graph, gradually finding the shortest path to all other nodes.

#### Usage Method
```python
import heapq


def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]

    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances


graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}
start_node = 'A'
shortest_distances = dijkstra(graph, start_node)
print(shortest_distances)
```
#### Common Practice
Dijkstra's algorithm is used in routing protocols, map applications to find the shortest route between two locations.

#### Best Practice
If the graph has negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm cannot be used. Instead, the Bellman - Ford algorithm should be used.


## Machine Learning - Related Algorithms

### K - Means Clustering
#### Fundamental Concept
K - Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers are called centroids).

#### Usage Method
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [4, 2], [4, 4], [4, 0]])
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 2, random_state = 0).fit(X)
print(kmeans.labels_)
print(kmeans.predict([[0, 0], [4, 4]]))
print(kmeans.cluster_centers_)
```
#### Common Practice
K - Means clustering is used in customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.

#### Best Practice
The choice of the number of clusters (k) is crucial. The elbow method can be used to determine the optimal value of k.
