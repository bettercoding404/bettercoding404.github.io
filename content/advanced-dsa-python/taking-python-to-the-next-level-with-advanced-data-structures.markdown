## Fundamental Concepts of Advanced Data Structures

### Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are commonly used in programming for tasks such as expression evaluation, backtracking, and function call management.

### Queues
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Queues are commonly used in programming for tasks such as task scheduling, breadth-first search, and message passing.

### Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element (node) contains a value and a reference (link) to the next node in the list. Linked lists are dynamic data structures, which means that they can grow or shrink in size during runtime. Linked lists are commonly used in programming for tasks such as dynamic memory allocation, implementing stacks and queues, and representing sparse matrices.

### Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node in a tree can have zero or more child nodes, except for the root node, which has no parent node. Trees are commonly used in programming for tasks such as searching, sorting, and representing hierarchical data.

### Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted. Graphs are commonly used in programming for tasks such as path finding, social network analysis, and circuit design.

## Usage Methods

### Implementing Stacks in Python
In Python, we can implement a stack using a list. The `append()` method can be used to add an element to the top of the stack, and the `pop()` method can be used to remove an element from the top of the stack.

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            return None
        return self.items.pop()

    def peek(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            return None
        return self.items[-1]

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)


# Example usage
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
print(stack.peek())  # Output: 2
```

### Implementing Queues in Python
In Python, we can implement a queue using the `deque` class from the `collections` module. The `append()` method can be used to add an element to the end of the queue, and the `popleft()` method can be used to remove an element from the front of the queue.

```python
from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = deque()

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            return None
        return self.items.popleft()

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)


# Example usage
queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
queue.enqueue(3)
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 1
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 2
```

### Implementing Linked Lists in Python
In Python, we can implement a linked list by defining a `Node` class and a `LinkedList` class. The `Node` class represents a single node in the linked list, and the `LinkedList` class represents the entire linked list.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.head is None

    def append(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if self.is_empty():
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node

    def display(self):
        elements = []
        current = self.head
        while current:
            elements.append(str(current.value))
            current = current.next
        print(" -> ".join(elements))


# Example usage
linked_list = LinkedList()
linked_list.append(1)
linked_list.append(2)
linked_list.append(3)
linked_list.display()  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3
```

### Implementing Trees in Python
In Python, we can implement a binary tree by defining a `TreeNode` class. Each node in the binary tree contains a value, a left child node, and a right child node.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None


# Example usage
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
```

### Implementing Graphs in Python
In Python, we can implement a graph using a dictionary. The keys of the dictionary represent the nodes in the graph, and the values represent the list of adjacent nodes.

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}


# Example usage
print(graph['A'])  # Output: ['B', 'C']
```

## Common Practices

### Using Stacks for Expression Evaluation
Stacks can be used to evaluate arithmetic expressions in postfix notation. The following is an example of using a stack to evaluate a postfix expression:

```python
def evaluate_postfix(expression):
    stack = []
    tokens = expression.split()
    for token in tokens:
        if token.isdigit():
            stack.append(int(token))
        else:
            operand2 = stack.pop()
            operand1 = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = operand1 + operand2
            elif token == '-':
                result = operand1 - operand2
            elif token == '*':
                result = operand1 * operand2
            elif token == '/':
                result = operand1 / operand2
            stack.append(result)
    return stack.pop()


# Example usage
expression = "3 4 + 2 *"
print(evaluate_postfix(expression))  # Output: 14
```

### Using Queues for Task Scheduling
Queues can be used to implement a simple task scheduler. The following is an example of using a queue to schedule tasks:

```python
from collections import deque

tasks = deque()
tasks.append('Task 1')
tasks.append('Task 2')
tasks.append('Task 3')

while tasks:
    task = tasks.popleft()
    print(f"Processing {task}")


```

### Using Linked Lists for Dynamic Memory Allocation
Linked lists can be used to implement a simple memory allocator. The following is an example of using a linked list to allocate and deallocate memory:

```python
class MemoryBlock:
    def __init__(self, start, size):
        self.start = start
        self.size = size
        self.next = None


class MemoryAllocator:
    def __init__(self, total_size):
        self.head = MemoryBlock(0, total_size)

    def allocate(self, size):
        current = self.head
        prev = None
        while current:
            if current.size >= size:
                if current.size == size:
                    if prev is None:
                        self.head = current.next
                    else:
                        prev.next = current.next
                else:
                    new_block = MemoryBlock(current.start + size, current.size - size)
                    new_block.next = current.next
                    if prev is None:
                        self.head = new_block
                    else:
                        prev.next = new_block
                return current.start
            prev = current
            current = current.next
        return None

    def deallocate(self, start, size):
        new_block = MemoryBlock(start, size)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_block
        elif start < self.head.start:
            new_block.next = self.head
            self.head = new_block
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next and current.next.start < start:
                current = current.next
            new_block.next = current.next
            current.next = new_block


# Example usage
allocator = MemoryAllocator(100)
address = allocator.allocate(20)
print(f"Allocated at address {address}")
allocator.deallocate(address, 20)
```

### Using Trees for Searching and Sorting
Binary search trees can be used to implement efficient searching and sorting algorithms. The following is an example of using a binary search tree to search for a value:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None


def search_bst(root, target):
    if root is None or root.value == target:
        return root
    if target < root.value:
        return search_bst(root.left, target)
    return search_bst(root.right, target)


# Example usage
root = TreeNode(5)
root.left = TreeNode(3)
root.right = TreeNode(7)
root.left.left = TreeNode(2)
root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
root.right.left = TreeNode(6)
root.right.right = TreeNode(8)

result = search_bst(root, 4)
if result:
    print(f"Found {result.value}")
else:
    print("Not found")


```

### Using Graphs for Path Finding
Graphs can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes using algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS). The following is an example of using BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph:

```python
from collections import deque


def bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        node, path = queue.popleft()
        if node == end:
            return path
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    return None


# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 'A', 'F')
print(path)  # Output: ['A', 'C', 'F']
```
