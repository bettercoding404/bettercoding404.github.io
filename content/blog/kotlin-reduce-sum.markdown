## Core Concepts of `reduce`
The `reduce` function in Kotlin is an extension function available on collections. It takes a binary operation as an argument and applies this operation cumulatively to the elements of the collection, starting from the first element. The binary operation takes two parameters: the accumulated value (the result of the previous operation) and the current element of the collection.

Here is the general syntax of the `reduce` function:
```kotlin
fun <S, T : S> Iterable<T>.reduce(operation: (acc: S, T) -> S): S
```
- `S` is the type of the accumulated value and the final result.
- `T` is the type of the elements in the collection, which must be a subtype of `S`.
- `operation` is a lambda function that takes the accumulated value (`acc`) and the current element and returns a new accumulated value.

## Calculating Sums with `reduce`
Let's start with a simple example of calculating the sum of a list of integers using `reduce`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Create a list of integers
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

    // Calculate the sum using reduce
    val sum = numbers.reduce { acc, num -> acc + num }

    // Print the result
    println("The sum of the numbers is: $sum")
}
```
In this example, the `reduce` function starts with the first element of the list (`1`) as the initial accumulated value (`acc`). Then, it iterates through the remaining elements of the list, adding each element to the accumulated value. The final result is the sum of all the elements in the list.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

### Summing Custom Objects
Suppose you have a list of custom objects, and you want to calculate the sum of a specific property of these objects. For example, consider a `Product` class with a `price` property.

```kotlin
data class Product(val name: String, val price: Double)

fun main() {
    // Create a list of products
    val products = listOf(
        Product("Apple", 1.5),
        Product("Banana", 0.8),
        Product("Orange", 2.0)
    )

    // Calculate the total price using reduce
    val totalPrice = products.reduce { acc, product -> acc + product.price }

    // Print the result
    println("The total price of the products is: $totalPrice")
}
```
In this example, the `reduce` function is used to calculate the total price of all the products in the list.

### Summing Elements in a Multi-Dimensional Array
You can also use `reduce` to calculate the sum of elements in a multi-dimensional array. For example, consider a 2D array of integers.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Create a 2D array of integers
    val matrix = arrayOf(
        intArrayOf(1, 2, 3),
        intArrayOf(4, 5, 6),
        intArrayOf(7, 8, 9)
    )

    // Calculate the sum of all elements in the matrix using reduce
    val sum = matrix.reduce { acc, row -> acc + row.sum() }

    // Print the result
    println("The sum of all elements in the matrix is: $sum")
}
```
In this example, the `reduce` function is used to calculate the sum of all elements in the 2D array.

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
The `reduce` function throws an exception if the collection is empty. To avoid this, you can use the `reduceOrNull` function, which returns `null` if the collection is empty.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Create an empty list of integers
    val emptyList = emptyList<Int>()

    // Calculate the sum using reduceOrNull
    val sum = emptyList.reduceOrNull { acc, num -> acc + num }

    // Print the result
    println("The sum of the empty list is: $sum")
}
```

### Readability
When using `reduce` for summation, it's important to keep the code readable. If the operation becomes too complex, consider breaking it down into smaller steps or using other collection functions in combination with `reduce`.

### Performance
The `reduce` function has a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the collection. For simple summation tasks, using the built-in `sum` function is usually more efficient and readable. However, `reduce` provides more flexibility for custom operations.

## Conclusion
The `reduce` function in Kotlin is a powerful tool for performing cumulative operations on collections, including summation. It allows developers to calculate sums in a concise and efficient manner, especially for custom objects and multi-dimensional arrays. By following the best practices, you can use `reduce` effectively and avoid common pitfalls.
