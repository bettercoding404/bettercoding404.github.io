title: "Kotlin `repeat until`: A Comprehensive Guide"
description: "
Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language that offers a plethora of features to simplify and enhance the development process. While Kotlin has built - in functions like `repeat` and conditional constructs, there isn't a direct `repeat until` construct like in some other languages. However, we can combine existing Kotlin features to achieve similar functionality. In this blog post, we'll explore the core concepts, typical usage scenarios, and best practices related to emulating a `repeat until` behavior in Kotlin.

## Core Concepts
### `repeat` Function
The `repeat` function in Kotlin is a convenient way to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It takes an integer parameter representing the number of repetitions and a lambda function that contains the code to be executed.

```kotlin
repeat(5) {
    println("This is iteration number $it")
}
```
In the above code, the lambda function will be executed 5 times, and the `it` variable represents the current iteration number (starting from 0).

### Conditional Execution
Kotlin provides `while` and `do - while` loops for conditional execution. The `do - while` loop is similar to the concept of `repeat until` as it executes the block of code at least once and then checks the condition.

```kotlin
var counter = 0
do {
    println("Counter value: $counter")
    counter++
} while (counter < 5)
```
Here, the block of code inside the `do` statement is executed first, and then the condition `counter < 5` is checked. If the condition is `true`, the loop continues; otherwise, it terminates.

## Typical Usage Scenarios
### Retrying an Operation
Suppose you are making an API call, and it might fail due to network issues. You can use a `repeat until` - like construct to retry the operation a certain number of times until it succeeds.

### User Input Validation
When taking user input, you might want to keep asking for input until the user provides valid data. A `repeat until` construct can be used to achieve this.

## Code Examples

### Emulating `repeat until` for Retrying an API Call
```kotlin
import java.io.IOException

fun makeAPICall(): Boolean {
    // Simulating an API call that might fail
    val random = (0..1).random()
    return if (random == 0) {
        println("API call succeeded")
        true
    } else {
        println("API call failed")
        false
    }
}

fun main() {
    var maxRetries = 3
    var success = false
    do {
        success = makeAPICall()
        maxRetries--
    } while (!success && maxRetries > 0)

    if (!success) {
        println("Failed after $maxRetries attempts.")
    }
}
```
In this example, we try to make an API call using the `makeAPICall` function. We keep retrying the call until it succeeds or we run out of retries.

### User Input Validation
```kotlin
import java.util.Scanner

fun main() {
    val scanner = Scanner(System.`in`)
    var validInput = false
    var userInput: Int
    do {
        print("Enter a number between 1 and 10: ")
        userInput = scanner.nextInt()
        validInput = userInput in 1..10
        if (!validInput) {
            println("Invalid input. Please try again.")
        }
    } while (!validInput)

    println("You entered a valid number: $userInput")
}
```
Here, we keep asking the user for input until they enter a number between 1 and 10.

## Best Practices
- **Limit the Number of Iterations**: When emulating `repeat until`, always set a maximum number of iterations to avoid infinite loops. This is especially important when dealing with operations that might fail repeatedly.
- **Error Handling**: Make sure to handle errors properly within the loop. For example, in the API call example, we could log more detailed error information if the call fails.
- **Code Readability**: Keep the code inside the loop simple and easy to understand. If the logic becomes too complex, consider breaking it down into smaller functions.

## Conclusion
Although Kotlin doesn't have a direct `repeat until` construct, we can easily achieve similar functionality by combining the `do - while` loop and other language features. This approach is useful in various scenarios such as retrying operations and validating user input. By following the best practices, we can write reliable and maintainable code.
