## Core Concepts

### Basics of Coroutines
A coroutine in Kotlin is a lightweight thread of execution. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a sequential manner. Coroutines are suspended and resumed, which means they can pause their execution and later resume from where they left off. They are managed by a coroutine context and a coroutine scope.

### Returning Values from Coroutines
In Kotlin, there are different ways to return values from coroutines. The most common approach is to use the `async` function from the `kotlinx.coroutines` library. The `async` function launches a new coroutine and returns a `Deferred` object. You can then use the `await` function on the `Deferred` object to get the result when it's available.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // Launch a coroutine using async
    val deferred: Deferred<Int> = async {
        // Simulate some long - running task
        delay(1000)
        42
    }
    // Wait for the result
    val result = deferred.await()
    println("The result is: $result")
}
```
In the above code, the `async` function launches a new coroutine that returns an integer value after a 1 - second delay. The `await` function is used to wait for the result of the coroutine.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

### Asynchronous Data Fetching
One of the most common use cases for returning values from coroutines is asynchronous data fetching. For example, when you need to fetch data from a remote server, you can use a coroutine to perform the network call asynchronously and return the fetched data.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import java.net.URL

suspend fun fetchData(): String {
    return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        val url = URL("https://example.com")
        val connection = url.openConnection()
        val inputStream = connection.getInputStream()
        inputStream.bufferedReader().use { it.readText() }
    }
}

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val data = fetchData()
    println("Fetched data: $data")
}
```
In this code, the `fetchData` function is a suspend function that uses `withContext` to switch to the `IO` dispatcher and perform the network call. The function returns the fetched data as a string.

### Parallel Processing
Coroutines can also be used for parallel processing. You can launch multiple coroutines simultaneously and wait for all of them to complete, then combine their results.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

suspend fun calculateSum(): Int {
    val job1 = async { 10 }
    val job2 = async { 20 }
    return job1.await() + job2.await()
}

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val sum = calculateSum()
    println("The sum is: $sum")
}
```
Here, two coroutines are launched using `async` to calculate values. The `await` function is used to wait for the results of both coroutines, and then the results are combined.

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
When returning values from coroutines, it's important to handle errors properly. You can use try - catch blocks inside the coroutine or handle exceptions when calling the `await` function.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

suspend fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return try {
        a / b
    } catch (e: ArithmeticException) {
        println("Error: ${e.message}")
        0
    }
}

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val result = divide(10, 0)
    println("The result is: $result")
}
```
In this code, the `divide` function uses a try - catch block to handle the `ArithmeticException` that may occur during the division operation.

### Avoiding Premature Returns
It's important to avoid premature returns from coroutines. Premature returns can lead to resource leaks or incomplete operations. Make sure that all necessary cleanup operations are performed before returning from a coroutine.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

suspend fun doWork(): Int {
    var resource: Int? = null
    try {
        // Simulate resource allocation
        resource = 1
        // Do some work
        delay(1000)
        return resource
    } finally {
        // Clean up the resource
        resource = null
    }
}

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val result = doWork()
    println("The result is: $result")
}
```
In the above code, the `finally` block ensures that the resource is cleaned up even if an exception occurs or the coroutine returns prematurely.

## Code Examples

### Simple Return from a Coroutine
```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val result = async {
        // Simulate some work
        delay(500)
        "Hello from coroutine"
    }.await()
    println(result)
}
```
This code demonstrates a simple coroutine that returns a string after a short delay.

### Returning from Nested Coroutines
```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val outerResult = async {
        val innerResult = async {
            delay(300)
            10
        }.await()
        innerResult * 2
    }.await()
    println("The final result is: $outerResult")
}
```
Here, we have a nested coroutine structure. The inner coroutine returns an integer, and the outer coroutine uses that result to calculate a new value.

### Handling Exceptions in Returning Coroutines
```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val job = async {
        try {
            delay(500)
            throw IllegalArgumentException("Invalid argument")
        } catch (e: IllegalArgumentException) {
            println("Caught exception: ${e.message}")
            -1
        }
    }
    val result = job.await()
    println("The result is: $result")
}
```
In this example, an exception is thrown inside the coroutine, and it's caught using a try - catch block. The coroutine then returns a default value.

## Conclusion
Returning values from Kotlin coroutines is a fundamental concept that allows you to write asynchronous and parallel code effectively. By understanding the core concepts, typical usage scenarios, and best practices, you can write robust and efficient coroutine - based code. Remember to handle errors properly and avoid premature returns to ensure the reliability of your code.
