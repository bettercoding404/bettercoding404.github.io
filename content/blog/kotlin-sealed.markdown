## Core Concepts of Kotlin Sealed Classes
A sealed class in Kotlin is a special type of abstract class that restricts the inheritance to a predefined set of subclasses. All subclasses of a sealed class must be declared in the same file as the sealed class itself. This design ensures that the set of possible subclasses is known at compile - time, which has several advantages.

One of the key benefits of sealed classes is that they enable exhaustive pattern matching. When using `when` expressions to handle different subclasses of a sealed class, the compiler can detect if all possible cases are covered. If not, it will raise a compilation error, preventing potential bugs caused by unhandled cases.

Here is a simple example of a sealed class and its subclasses:
```kotlin
// Define a sealed class
sealed class Shape {
    // Subclasses of the sealed class
    class Circle(val radius: Double) : Shape()
    class Rectangle(val width: Double, val height: Double) : Shape()
    object Square : Shape()
}

// Function to calculate the area of a shape
fun calculateArea(shape: Shape): Double {
    return when (shape) {
        is Shape.Circle -> Math.PI * shape.radius * shape.radius
        is Shape.Rectangle -> shape.width * shape.height
        is Shape.Square -> 1.0 // For simplicity, assume side length is 1
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Shape` sealed class has three subclasses: `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square`. The `calculateArea` function uses a `when` expression to handle each type of shape. Since the `Shape` class is sealed, the compiler can verify that all possible cases are covered.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

### Representing a Finite Set of States
Sealed classes are excellent for representing a finite set of states in an application. For example, consider a media player with different states like `Playing`, `Paused`, and `Stopped`.
```kotlin
// Sealed class representing media player states
sealed class MediaPlayerState {
    object Playing : MediaPlayerState()
    object Paused : MediaPlayerState()
    object Stopped : MediaPlayerState()
}

// Function to handle media player actions based on state
fun handleMediaPlayerAction(state: MediaPlayerState) {
    when (state) {
        is MediaPlayerState.Playing -> println("Player is currently playing.")
        is MediaPlayerState.Paused -> println("Player is paused.")
        is MediaPlayerState.Stopped -> println("Player is stopped.")
    }
}
```

### Handling Results and Errors
In scenarios where a function can either return a successful result or an error, sealed classes can be used to represent the different outcomes.
```kotlin
// Sealed class for result handling
sealed class Result<out T> {
    data class Success<out T>(val data: T) : Result<T>()
    data class Error(val exception: Exception) : Result<Nothing>()
}

// Function that returns a result
fun divideNumbers(a: Int, b: Int): Result<Double> {
    return try {
        Result.Success(a.toDouble() / b)
    } catch (e: ArithmeticException) {
        Result.Error(e)
    }
}

// Function to handle the result
fun handleResult(result: Result<Double>) {
    when (result) {
        is Result.Success -> println("The result is ${result.data}")
        is Result.Error -> println("An error occurred: ${result.exception.message}")
    }
}
```

### Pattern Matching
As shown in the previous examples, sealed classes work seamlessly with pattern matching. The compiler can ensure that all subclasses are handled in a `when` expression, which is especially useful in functional programming - style code.

## Best Practices

### Keep the Hierarchy Simple
It's important to keep the sealed class hierarchy simple and focused. Avoid creating overly complex hierarchies with too many levels of subclasses. A simple hierarchy makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

### Use Data Classes as Subclasses
When the subclasses need to hold data, using data classes is a good practice. Data classes automatically provide useful methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`, which can simplify the code and reduce boilerplate.

## Conclusion
Kotlin sealed classes are a valuable addition to the language, offering a way to create restricted class hierarchies that enhance code safety and maintainability. They are particularly useful in scenarios where you need to represent a finite set of states, handle results and errors, or perform exhaustive pattern matching. By following best practices such as keeping the hierarchy simple and using data classes as subclasses, you can make the most of this powerful feature in your Kotlin projects.
