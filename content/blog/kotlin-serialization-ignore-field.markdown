title: "Kotlin Serialization: Ignoring Fields"
description: "
Kotlin Serialization is a powerful library that allows developers to convert Kotlin objects to and from various formats such as JSON, XML, and others. In many real - world scenarios, not all fields of a Kotlin class need to be serialized. For example, you might have a field that holds a temporary state, or a field that contains sensitive information that should not be exposed during serialization. This blog post will explore how to ignore fields during Kotlin serialization, covering core concepts, typical usage scenarios, and best practices.

## Core Concepts
In Kotlin Serialization, there are two main ways to ignore a field during serialization:

### Using the `@Transient` Annotation
The `@Transient` annotation can be used to mark a property as non - serializable. When a property is marked with `@Transient`, it will be skipped during the serialization process.

### Using the `@Contextual` and Custom Serializers
For more complex scenarios, you can use the `@Contextual` annotation along with custom serializers. This allows you to have fine - grained control over which fields are serialized based on certain conditions.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

### Temporary State
Imagine you have a class that represents a user session. The class might have a field that keeps track of the number of requests made during the session. This field is only relevant for the current session and does not need to be serialized.

### Sensitive Information
If you have a class that represents a user profile, it might contain fields like a password or a credit card number. These fields should not be serialized to prevent sensitive information from being exposed.

### Calculated Fields
Some fields in a class might be calculated based on other fields. For example, a `totalPrice` field that is calculated from the `price` and `quantity` fields. Since the `totalPrice` can be recalculated, there is no need to serialize it.

## Code Examples

### Using the `@Transient` Annotation
```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.Serializable
import kotlinx.serialization.json.Json

// Define a serializable class
@Serializable
data class User(
    val name: String,
    val age: Int,
    @Transient val temporaryField: String = "This won't be serialized"
)

fun main() {
    val user = User("John Doe", 30)
    // Serialize the object to JSON
    val json = Json.encodeToString(user)
    println(json) 
    // Output: {"name":"John Doe","age":30}
}
```
In this example, the `temporaryField` is marked with `@Transient`, so it is not included in the serialized JSON output.

### Using Custom Serializers
```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.*
import kotlinx.serialization.json.Json

// Define a custom serializer
object SensitiveUserSerializer : KSerializer<User> {
    override val descriptor: SerialDescriptor = buildClassSerialDescriptor("SensitiveUser") {
        element<String>("name")
        element<Int>("age")
    }

    override fun serialize(encoder: Encoder, value: User) {
        encoder.encodeStructure(descriptor) {
            encodeStringElement(descriptor, 0, value.name)
            encodeIntElement(descriptor, 1, value.age)
        }
    }

    override fun deserialize(decoder: Decoder): User {
        return decoder.decodeStructure(descriptor) {
            var name: String = ""
            var age: Int = 0
            while (true) {
                when (val index = decodeElementIndex(descriptor)) {
                    0 -> name = decodeStringElement(descriptor, 0)
                    1 -> age = decodeIntElement(descriptor, 1)
                    CompositeDecoder.DECODE_DONE -> break
                    else -> error("Unexpected index: $index")
                }
            }
            User(name, age)
        }
    }
}

@Serializable(with = SensitiveUserSerializer::class)
data class User(
    val name: String,
    val age: Int,
    val password: String
)

fun main() {
    val user = User("Jane Smith", 25, "secretpassword")
    val json = Json.encodeToString(user)
    println(json) 
    // Output: {"name":"Jane Smith","age":25}
}
```
In this example, the `password` field is not serialized because the custom serializer only includes the `name` and `age` fields.

## Best Practices

### Use `@Transient` for Simple Cases
If you have a simple field that you want to ignore, using the `@Transient` annotation is the easiest and most straightforward approach.

### Custom Serializers for Complex Logic
For more complex scenarios where you need to make serialization decisions based on certain conditions, use custom serializers.

### Keep Serialization Logic Separate
When using custom serializers, keep the serialization logic separate from the business logic of the class. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to test.

## Conclusion
Kotlin Serialization provides several ways to ignore fields during the serialization process. Whether you use the `@Transient` annotation for simple cases or custom serializers for complex scenarios, you can control which fields are included in the serialized output. By understanding the core concepts, typical usage scenarios, and best practices, you can effectively use Kotlin Serialization to handle field ignoring in your projects.
