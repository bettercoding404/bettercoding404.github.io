title: "Kotlin Serialization: Ignore Unknown Keys"
description: "
In modern software development, data serialization and deserialization are common operations, especially when dealing with data exchange between different systems or components. Kotlin Serialization is a powerful library that simplifies these processes, allowing developers to convert Kotlin objects to and from various data formats such as JSON, XML, and more.  One common issue that developers face during deserialization is the presence of unknown keys in the data. These unknown keys can cause deserialization to fail, leading to runtime exceptions. Kotlin Serialization provides a mechanism to ignore these unknown keys, which can make the deserialization process more robust and flexible. In this blog post, we will explore the core concepts, typical usage scenarios, and best practices related to ignoring unknown keys in Kotlin Serialization.

## Core Concepts
### Kotlin Serialization Basics
Kotlin Serialization is a plugin and runtime library that enables automatic serialization and deserialization of Kotlin objects. It uses Kotlin's metadata to generate serialization code at compile time, which means there is no need for reflection at runtime.

### Unknown Keys
Unknown keys are fields that are present in the serialized data but do not have corresponding properties in the target Kotlin class. For example, if your Kotlin class has properties `name` and `age`, but the JSON data contains an additional field `address`, then `address` is an unknown key.

### Ignoring Unknown Keys
Kotlin Serialization allows you to configure the deserialization process to ignore unknown keys. When this option is enabled, the library will skip over any unknown keys in the serialized data and only deserialize the fields that match the properties of the target Kotlin class.

## Typical Usage Scenarios
### Versioning
When working with APIs, the data format may change over time. New fields may be added to the API response, but your application may not be ready to handle them yet. By ignoring unknown keys, you can ensure that your application can still deserialize the data even if new fields are added.

### Third - Party APIs
When consuming data from third - party APIs, you have no control over the data format. The API provider may add or remove fields at any time. Ignoring unknown keys can make your application more resilient to these changes.

### Data Interoperability
When exchanging data between different systems or components, the data models may not be exactly the same. Ignoring unknown keys can help bridge the gap between different data models.

## Code Examples

### Prerequisites
First, make sure you have the Kotlin Serialization plugin and the JSON library added to your project. In a Gradle project, you can add the following dependencies:
```groovy
plugins {
    kotlin("plugin.serialization") version "1.8.20"
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:1.5.1")
}
```

### Example 1: Ignoring Unknown Keys in JSON Deserialization
```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.Serializable
import kotlinx.serialization.decodeFromString
import kotlinx.serialization.json.Json

// Define a Kotlin data class
@Serializable
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

fun main() {
    // JSON data with an unknown key
    val json = """
        {
            "name": "John",
            "age": 30,
            "address": "123 Main St"
        }
    """.trimIndent()

    // Configure Json to ignore unknown keys
    val jsonParser = Json { ignoreUnknownKeys = true }

    // Deserialize the JSON data
    val person = jsonParser.decodeFromString<Person>(json)
    println(person)
}
```
In this example, we define a `Person` data class with `name` and `age` properties. The JSON data contains an additional `address` field, which is an unknown key. We configure the `Json` parser to ignore unknown keys using the `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` option. Then we deserialize the JSON data into a `Person` object.

## Best Practices
### Explicit Configuration
Always explicitly configure the serialization library to ignore unknown keys. This makes your code more readable and maintainable, as other developers can clearly see your intention.

### Error Handling
Even though you are ignoring unknown keys, it's still important to handle other potential deserialization errors, such as invalid data types or missing required fields.

### Testing
Write unit tests to ensure that your deserialization process works correctly when unknown keys are present. Test different scenarios, including different types of unknown keys and different data formats.

## Conclusion
Ignoring unknown keys in Kotlin Serialization is a powerful feature that can make your application more robust and flexible, especially when dealing with data that may change over time or come from external sources. By understanding the core concepts, typical usage scenarios, and following best practices, you can effectively use this feature in your projects.
