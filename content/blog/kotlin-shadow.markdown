title: "Understanding Kotlin Shadow"
description: "
In the world of Kotlin development, Kotlin shadow is a concept that plays a crucial role in managing dependencies and creating modular and distributable projects. Kotlin shadow, often associated with the Shadow plugin for Gradle, allows developers to create fat JARs (also known as uber - JARs) that include all the necessary dependencies of a Kotlin project. This is particularly useful when you want to deploy a single executable JAR file that can run independently without the need to manage multiple external libraries.  In this blog post, we will explore the core concepts of Kotlin shadow, its typical usage scenarios, and best practices to help intermediate - to - advanced software engineers make the most of this powerful tool.

## Core Concepts
### Fat JARs
A fat JAR is a self - contained JAR file that includes not only the classes of your main Kotlin project but also all the classes from its dependencies. This means that when you distribute a fat JAR, you don't need to worry about users having to download and manage the external libraries separately.

### Shadow Plugin
The Shadow plugin for Gradle is the key to creating fat JARs in Kotlin projects. It provides a simple and flexible way to configure which dependencies should be included in the fat JAR and how they should be packaged. The plugin works by analyzing the project's dependencies and then creating a new JAR file that combines all the necessary classes.

### Dependency Management
Kotlin shadow allows you to have fine - grained control over which dependencies are included in the fat JAR. You can exclude certain dependencies, relocate classes from specific libraries to avoid naming conflicts, and even merge resources from different dependencies.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

### Deployment
When you need to deploy a Kotlin application to a production environment, packaging it as a fat JAR can simplify the deployment process. You can simply copy the fat JAR to the target server and run it without having to install and configure multiple external libraries.

### Distribution
If you are developing a Kotlin library or tool that you want to distribute to other developers, a fat JAR can be a convenient way to provide all the necessary functionality in a single file. Other developers can easily include the fat JAR in their projects without having to manage the individual dependencies.

### Testing
In some cases, you may want to run your Kotlin tests in an isolated environment. Packaging your test code along with its dependencies in a fat JAR can make it easier to run the tests on different machines or in a continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

## Code Examples

### Step 1: Apply the Shadow Plugin
First, you need to apply the Shadow plugin in your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.6.21"
    id("com.github.johnrengelman.shadow") version "7.1.2"
}

group = "com.example"
version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.36")
    implementation("ch.qos.logback:logback - classic:1.2.11")
}

// Configure the Shadow plugin
shadowJar {
    archiveBaseName.set("my - kotlin - app")
    archiveVersion.set("1.0")
    manifest {
        attributes(mapOf("Main - Class" to "com.example.MainKt"))
    }
    // Exclude some unnecessary files
    exclude("META - INF/*.SF", "META - INF/*.DSA", "META - INF/*.RSA")
}
```

### Step 2: Create a Kotlin Application
Create a simple Kotlin application in the `src/main/kotlin/com/example` directory:

```kotlin
// src/main/kotlin/com/example/MainKt.kt
package com.example

import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory

fun main() {
    val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("Main")
    logger.info("Hello, Kotlin Shadow!")
}
```

### Step 3: Build the Fat JAR
Run the following command in your terminal to build the fat JAR:

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

After the build is successful, you will find the fat JAR file in the `build/libs` directory. You can run the fat JAR using the following command:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/my - kotlin - app - 1.0.jar
```

## Best Practices

### Exclude Unnecessary Dependencies
When creating a fat JAR, it's important to exclude any dependencies that are not necessary for the application to run. This can reduce the size of the fat JAR and improve the startup time of the application.

### Relocate Classes
If you have multiple dependencies that use the same class names, you can use the Shadow plugin to relocate the classes from one of the dependencies to a different package. This can help avoid naming conflicts.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
shadowJar {
    relocate("org.slf4j", "com.example.slf4j")
}
```

### Test the Fat JAR
Before deploying or distributing the fat JAR, make sure to test it thoroughly to ensure that all the dependencies are included correctly and that the application runs as expected.

## Conclusion
Kotlin shadow, with the help of the Shadow plugin for Gradle, is a powerful tool for creating fat JARs in Kotlin projects. It simplifies the deployment and distribution process by packaging all the necessary dependencies into a single executable JAR file. By understanding the core concepts, typical usage scenarios, and best practices, intermediate - to - advanced software engineers can effectively use Kotlin shadow to create more modular and distributable applications.
