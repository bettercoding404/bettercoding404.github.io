In the world of Kotlin programming, dealing with collections is a common task. One useful operation on collections is shuffling, which randomly reorders the elements within a collection. The `shuffled` function in Kotlin provides a straightforward way to achieve this.

## Core Concepts of `kotlin shuffled`
The `shuffled` function is an extension function available on Kotlin collections. It returns a new list with the same elements as the original collection but in a random order. The original collection remains unchanged, as `shuffled` is a non - mutating operation.

Under the hood, the `shuffled` function uses the default random number generator provided by the Kotlin standard library. If you want to use a custom random number generator, you can pass it as an argument to the `shuffled` function.

## Typical Usage Scenarios
### 1. Game Development
In games, shuffling is often used to randomize the order of cards in a deck, the order of opponents, or the appearance of items. For example, in a card game, you can shuffle the deck of cards before dealing them to the players.

### 2. Data Sampling
When you need to select a random sample from a large dataset, shuffling the dataset first can ensure that the sample is truly random. This is useful in machine learning for splitting datasets into training and testing sets.

### 3. Randomizing UI Elements
In user interfaces, you might want to display elements in a random order to add variety. For example, a photo gallery app could shuffle the order of photos each time the user opens the gallery.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Basic Shuffling
```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Create a list of integers
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    // Shuffle the list
    val shuffledNumbers = numbers.shuffled()
    println("Original list: $numbers")
    println("Shuffled list: $shuffledNumbers")
}
```
In this example, we create a list of integers and then use the `shuffled` function to create a new list with the elements in a random order. The original list remains unchanged.

### Example 2: Shuffling with a Custom Random Generator
```kotlin
import kotlin.random.Random

fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    // Create a custom random generator
    val customRandom = Random(42) // Using a fixed seed for reproducibility
    val shuffledNumbers = numbers.shuffled(customRandom)
    println("Original list: $numbers")
    println("Shuffled list with custom random: $shuffledNumbers")
}
```
Here, we create a custom random number generator with a fixed seed. This is useful when you want to reproduce the same shuffled order for debugging or testing purposes.

### Example 3: Shuffling a Mutable List
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val mutableNumbers = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val shuffledMutableNumbers = mutableNumbers.shuffled()
    println("Original mutable list: $mutableNumbers")
    println("Shuffled mutable list: $shuffledMutableNumbers")
}
```
Even though we are working with a mutable list, the `shuffled` function still returns a new list, leaving the original mutable list unchanged.

## Best Practices
### 1. Use the Appropriate Random Generator
If you need reproducibility, use a custom random generator with a fixed seed. For truly random results in production, rely on the default random generator.

### 2. Be Aware of Performance
Shuffling large collections can be computationally expensive. If possible, limit the size of the collection you are shuffling or use more efficient algorithms for specific use cases.

### 3. Keep the Original Collection Intact
Since `shuffled` is a non - mutating operation, it's a good practice to keep the original collection intact and work with the shuffled one. This helps in maintaining the integrity of your data.

## Conclusion
The `shuffled` function in Kotlin is a powerful and convenient tool for randomizing the order of elements in a collection. It has a wide range of applications in game development, data sampling, and UI design. By understanding its core concepts, typical usage scenarios, and following best practices, intermediate - to - advanced software engineers can effectively integrate the `shuffled` function into their Kotlin projects.
