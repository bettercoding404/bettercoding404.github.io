title: "Kotlin Singleton List: A Comprehensive Guide"
description: "
In Kotlin, a singleton list is a type of list that contains exactly one element. It is an immutable data structure, which means once it is created, its content cannot be changed. Singleton lists are useful in various programming scenarios, especially when you need to represent a collection with a single item in a type - safe and memory - efficient way. This blog post will explore the core concepts, typical usage scenarios, and best practices related to Kotlin singleton lists.

## Core Concepts of Kotlin Singleton List
A singleton list in Kotlin is an implementation of the `List` interface. It inherits all the properties and methods of a regular list, but it always has a size of 1. Since it is immutable, operations like adding or removing elements are not supported. This immutability makes it thread - safe and suitable for sharing across different parts of an application.

The Kotlin standard library provides a convenient way to create a singleton list using the `listOf` function when only one argument is passed. Under the hood, the `listOf` function optimizes the creation of a singleton list to save memory and improve performance.

## Creating a Kotlin Singleton List
In Kotlin, you can create a singleton list using the `listOf` function. Here is an example:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Create a singleton list of integers
    val singletonList: List<Int> = listOf(42)

    // Print the singleton list
    println(singletonList)

    // Print the size of the singleton list
    println("Size of the singleton list: ${singletonList.size}")
}
```
In this code:
- We first use the `listOf` function with a single integer argument `42` to create a singleton list of integers.
- Then we print the singleton list, which will output `[42]`.
- Finally, we print the size of the singleton list, which will be `1`.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

### 1. Function Parameter with a List Requirement
Suppose you have a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter, but in some cases, you only have a single string to pass. You can use a singleton list:

```kotlin
fun processStrings(strings: List<String>) {
    strings.forEach {
        println("Processing: $it")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val singleString = "Hello"
    val singletonStringList = listOf(singleString)
    processStrings(singletonStringList)
}
```
In this example, the `processStrings` function expects a list of strings. By creating a singleton list with the single string, we can easily pass it to the function.

### 2. Returning a Single Result
When a function is designed to return a list of results, but in some cases, it only has one result to return, a singleton list can be used:

```kotlin
fun findMatchingNumbers(numbers: List<Int>, target: Int): List<Int> {
    val matching = numbers.filter { it == target }
    return if (matching.size == 1) {
        listOf(matching.first())
    } else {
        matching
    }
}

fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 2)
    val result = findMatchingNumbers(numbers, 3)
    println(result)
}
```
Here, the `findMatchingNumbers` function returns a list of numbers that match the target. If there is only one matching number, it returns a singleton list.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Immutability Wisely
Since singleton lists are immutable, they are ideal for scenarios where data integrity needs to be maintained. Avoid trying to modify a singleton list. If you need to add or remove elements, consider creating a new list instead.

### 2. Memory Efficiency
Singleton lists are memory - efficient compared to creating a regular list with a single element. Use them whenever you have a single item to represent as a list.

### 3. Type Safety
Always ensure that the type of the element in the singleton list matches the expected type. This helps in preventing runtime type errors.

## Conclusion
Kotlin singleton lists are a powerful and useful feature in the Kotlin standard library. They provide a simple and efficient way to represent a collection with a single element. By understanding the core concepts, typical usage scenarios, and best practices, intermediate - to - advanced software engineers can effectively use singleton lists in their Kotlin projects, leading to more robust and efficient code.
