title: "FastAPI for Beginners: Your First API Step by Step"
description: "
In the world of web development, creating APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) is a crucial task. APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other, enabling the exchange of data and functionality. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It offers a great balance between ease of use and high performance, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of creating your first API using FastAPI, covering fundamental concepts, usage methods, common practices, and best practices.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

## Installation
The first step is to install FastAPI and Uvicorn. Uvicorn is an ASGI server that will run our FastAPI application. You can install them using `pip`, the Python package manager. Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## Your First FastAPI Application
Let's create a simple "Hello, World!" API using FastAPI. Create a new Python file, for example, `main.py`, and add the following code:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

# Create a FastAPI instance
app = FastAPI()

# Define a route
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

## Understanding the Code
- **Importing FastAPI**: We import the `FastAPI` class from the `fastapi` library. This class is used to create our FastAPI application.
- **Creating an Instance**: We create an instance of the `FastAPI` class named `app`. This instance will be the core of our application.
- **Defining a Route**: We use the `@app.get("/")` decorator to define a route. The `@app.get` part indicates that this is a GET request, and the `"/"` is the path of the route. The function `read_root` is the handler for this route. It returns a dictionary, which will be automatically converted to JSON by FastAPI.

## Running the Application
To run the FastAPI application, we use Uvicorn. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where your `main.py` file is located and run the following command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
- `main` is the name of the Python file (without the `.py` extension).
- `app` is the name of the `FastAPI` instance we created in the file.
- `--reload` is an optional flag that enables auto - reloading. This means that whenever you make changes to your code, the server will automatically restart.

## Testing the API
Once the server is running, you can test the API in your web browser or using tools like `curl` or Postman.
- **Using a Web Browser**: Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You should see the JSON response `{"Hello": "World"}`.
- **Using `curl`**: In the terminal, run the following command:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
You will get the same JSON response.

## Common Practices and Best Practices
### Input Validation
FastAPI uses Python type hints for input validation. For example, if you want to create a route that accepts a parameter, you can do the following:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```
Here, `item_id` is expected to be an integer. If a non - integer value is provided, FastAPI will automatically return a validation error.

### Error Handling
FastAPI provides built - in error handling. You can also define custom error handlers. For example:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int):
    if item_id < 0:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Item ID cannot be negative")
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

### Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation. You can access it at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` (Swagger UI) or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` (ReDoc). This documentation is very useful for testing and understanding your API.

### Code Organization
As your application grows, it's important to organize your code. You can use modules and routers to split your code into smaller, more manageable parts.
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter

app = FastAPI()
router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

app.include_router(router)
```

## Conclusion
FastAPI is a powerful and easy - to - use web framework for building APIs with Python. In this blog post, we walked you through the process of creating your first FastAPI application, from installation to testing. We also covered some common practices and best practices, such as input validation, error handling, documentation, and code organization. With these basics, you are well on your way to building more complex and robust APIs using FastAPI.
