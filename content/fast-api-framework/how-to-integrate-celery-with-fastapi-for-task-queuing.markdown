title: "How to Integrate Celery with FastAPI for Task Queuing"
description: "
In modern web applications, there are often tasks that are time - consuming or resource - intensive, such as sending emails, processing large files, or performing complex calculations. Running these tasks synchronously can significantly slow down the application's response time, leading to a poor user experience.   FastAPI is a modern, fast (high - performance) web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. Celery, on the other hand, is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system. Integrating Celery with FastAPI allows you to offload these time - consuming tasks to a task queue, ensuring that your FastAPI application remains responsive and efficient.

## Fundamental Concepts

### What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs in Python. It is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts. FastAPI uses type hints to validate, serialize, and deserialize data, and it can generate interactive API documentation automatically. It is known for its high performance, thanks to features like asynchronous programming support and the use of modern Python standards.

### What is Celery?
Celery is a distributed task queue system. It allows you to offload tasks from your main application to a separate worker process. Celery uses message queues (such as RabbitMQ, Redis) to communicate between the main application and the worker processes. A Celery application consists of a producer (the main application that enqueues tasks), a broker (the message queue), and a consumer (the worker process that executes the tasks).

### Why Integrate Celery with FastAPI?
Integrating Celery with FastAPI helps in decoupling time - consuming tasks from the main request - response cycle of the FastAPI application. This ensures that the application can respond to user requests quickly, even when there are long - running tasks to be performed. It also improves the scalability of the application as you can easily add more worker processes to handle the task load.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Python and web development
- Familiarity with FastAPI and Celery concepts

## Installation
First, create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn celery redis
```

Here, we are using Redis as the message broker and result backend for Celery.

## Setting Up Celery

### Defining Celery Tasks
Create a file named `celery_app.py`:
```python
from celery import Celery

# Initialize Celery
celery_app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0', backend='redis://localhost:6379/0')


@celery_app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

```
In this code, we initialize a Celery application with Redis as the broker and result backend. We also define a simple task `add` that adds two numbers.

## Integrating Celery with FastAPI

### Enqueuing Tasks from FastAPI
Create a file named `main.py`:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from celery_app import add

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/add")
async def perform_addition(x: int, y: int):
    task = add.delay(x, y)
    return {"task_id": task.id}


@app.get("/result/{task_id}")
async def get_result(task_id: str):
    result = add.AsyncResult(task_id)
    if result.ready():
        return {"status": "completed", "result": result.result}
    else:
        return {"status": "pending"}

```
In the `/add` endpoint, we enqueue the `add` task using the `delay` method and return the task ID. The `/result/{task_id}` endpoint allows us to check the status of the task and get the result if it is ready.

## Running the Application

### Start the Redis Server
If you haven't already, start the Redis server:
```bash
redis - server
```

### Start the Celery Worker
```bash
celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

### Start the FastAPI Application
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Now you can access the FastAPI endpoints at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Common Practices

### Error Handling
In Celery tasks, it's important to handle errors properly. You can use try - except blocks in your tasks to catch and log errors. For example:
```python
@celery_app.task
def add(x, y):
    try:
        return x + y
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error
        import logging
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.error(f"Error in add task: {e}")
        return None

```

### Monitoring Celery Tasks
You can use tools like Flower to monitor Celery tasks. Install Flower:
```bash
pip install flower
```
Start Flower:
```bash
celery -A celery_app flower
```
Flower provides a web - based interface to monitor Celery tasks, view task status, and manage workers.

## Best Practices

### Task Retries and Backoff
If a task fails due to a transient error (e.g., network issue), you can configure Celery to retry the task. You can also implement an exponential backoff strategy to increase the time between retries.
```python
@celery_app.task(bind=True, default_retry_delay=300, max_retries=5)
def add(self, x, y):
    try:
        return x + y
    except Exception as e:
        self.retry(exc=e, countdown=2 ** self.request.retries)

```

### Using Result Backends Wisely
If you don't need the result of a task, don't use a result backend. Storing results in a result backend can consume a significant amount of memory, especially for long - running tasks. If you do need the result, make sure to clean up old results regularly.

## Conclusion
Integrating Celery with FastAPI is a powerful way to handle time - consuming tasks in your web application. By offloading these tasks to a task queue, you can ensure that your FastAPI application remains responsive and scalable. We have covered the fundamental concepts, installation, setup, and integration process. Additionally, we have discussed common and best practices to help you build a robust and efficient application.
