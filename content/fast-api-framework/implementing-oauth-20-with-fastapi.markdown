title: "Implementing OAuth 2.0 with FastAPI"
description: "
OAuth 2.0 is an open standard for authorization that enables third - party applications to access user resources on a server in a secure and controlled manner. FastAPI, on the other hand, is a modern, fast (high - performance) web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. Combining these two technologies allows developers to build secure and scalable APIs that support third - party authentication and authorization.  In this blog post, we will explore the fundamental concepts of implementing OAuth 2.0 with FastAPI, learn about usage methods, common practices, and best practices.

## Fundamental Concepts

### OAuth 2.0
OAuth 2.0 works on the principle of tokens. A client application requests an access token from an authorization server on behalf of a resource owner (the user). The access token is then used to access the protected resources on the resource server.

There are four main roles in OAuth 2.0:
- **Resource Owner**: The user who owns the protected resources.
- **Client Application**: The third - party application that wants to access the user's resources.
- **Authorization Server**: Issues access tokens after validating the client and the user's consent.
- **Resource Server**: Holds the protected resources and validates the access tokens.

### FastAPI
FastAPI is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for data validation. It uses Python type hints to provide automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation generation.

## Usage Methods

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, you need to install FastAPI and `python - jose[cryptography]` for handling JWT (JSON Web Tokens) which are commonly used in OAuth 2.0.

```bash
pip install fastapi "python-jose[cryptography]" uvicorn
```

### Step 2: Set up a Basic FastAPI Application
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

### Step 3: Implement OAuth 2.0 with JWT
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from jose import JWTError, jwt
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Secret key for signing the JWT
SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30

# OAuth2 scheme
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")


class TokenData(BaseModel):
    username: str | None = None


async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        username: str = payload.get("sub")
        if username is None:
            raise credentials_exception
        token_data = TokenData(username=username)
    except JWTError:
        raise credentials_exception
    return token_data


app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/protected")
async def protected_route(current_user: TokenData = Depends(get_current_user)):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {current_user.username}! This is a protected route."}


```

### Step 4: Run the Application
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Common Practices

### Token Generation and Validation
- **Token Generation**: When a user logs in or authorizes an application, the authorization server generates a JWT. The JWT contains claims such as the user's identity (subject), issuer, and expiration time.
- **Token Validation**: The resource server validates the JWT by checking its signature using the secret key and verifying the expiration time.

### User Consent
In a real - world scenario, the client application should obtain the user's consent before requesting an access token. This can be done by redirecting the user to the authorization server's consent page.

## Best Practices

### Secure Secret Key Management
The secret key used for signing JWTs should be kept secret. In a production environment, it is recommended to use environment variables to store the secret key.

```python
import os

SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
```

### Token Expiration
Set an appropriate expiration time for access tokens. Short - lived access tokens reduce the risk of token misuse if they are compromised.

### Error Handling
Proper error handling should be implemented in both the authorization server and the resource server. For example, when a token is invalid, the resource server should return a 401 Unauthorized response.

## Conclusion
Implementing OAuth 2.0 with FastAPI provides a powerful way to build secure and scalable APIs. By understanding the fundamental concepts, following the usage methods, and applying common and best practices, developers can ensure that their applications are protected against unauthorized access. OAuth 2.0's flexibility and FastAPI's performance make them a great combination for modern web development.
