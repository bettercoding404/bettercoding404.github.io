## Fundamental Concepts
### Layered Architecture
Layered architecture divides an enterprise application into multiple layers, each with a specific responsibility. The common layers are:
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interface interactions and presents data to the user.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core business rules and processes.
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages the interaction with the data source, such as a database.

### Data Transfer Object (DTO)
A DTO is an object that carries data between processes. It is used to reduce the number of method calls between layers and improve performance. DTOs are usually simple Java objects with getters and setters.

### Repository Pattern
The repository pattern provides an abstraction layer between the business logic and the data access layer. It encapsulates the logic for retrieving and storing data, making the business logic more independent of the data source.

### Service Layer
The service layer acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the business logic layer. It provides a set of services that the presentation layer can call to perform business operations.

## Usage Methods
### Implementing Layered Architecture
To implement a layered architecture in Java, you can create separate packages for each layer. For example:
```
com.example.app
├── presentation
├── business
└── dataaccess
```
The `presentation` package contains classes related to the user interface, the `business` package contains the business logic classes, and the `dataaccess` package contains the data access classes.

### Using DTOs
To use DTOs, you first need to define the DTO class. For example:
```java
public class UserDTO {
    private String username;
    private String email;

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }
}
```
Then, you can use the DTO to transfer data between layers.

### Implementing the Repository Pattern
To implement the repository pattern, you need to define an interface for the repository and its implementation. For example:
```java
// Repository interface
public interface UserRepository {
    User findById(int id);
    void save(User user);
}

// Repository implementation
public class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepository {
    @Override
    public User findById(int id) {
        // Code to retrieve user from database
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public void save(User user) {
        // Code to save user to database
    }
}
```

### Using the Service Layer
To use the service layer, you can create a service class that depends on the repository. For example:
```java
public class UserService {
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User getUserById(int id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id);
    }

    public void saveUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
```

## Common Practices
### Error Handling
In enterprise applications, proper error handling is crucial. You should use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions at the appropriate layers. For example, in the data access layer, you can catch database-related exceptions and throw custom exceptions to the business logic layer.

### Transaction Management
Transactions are used to ensure the integrity of data. In Java, you can use the Java Transaction API (JTA) or the Spring Framework's transaction management features to manage transactions.

### Caching
Caching can improve the performance of enterprise applications by reducing the number of database queries. You can use caching frameworks such as Ehcache or Redis to implement caching in your application.

## Best Practices
### Code Reusability
Write code that can be reused across different parts of the application. For example, you can create utility classes or methods that perform common tasks.

### Unit Testing
Write unit tests for your code to ensure its correctness. You can use testing frameworks such as JUnit or TestNG to write unit tests.

### Documentation
Document your code to make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain. You can use JavaDoc to generate documentation for your classes and methods.

## Code Examples
### Layered Architecture Example
```java
// Presentation layer
public class UserController {
    private UserService userService;

    public UserController(UserService userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }

    public User getUser(int id) {
        return userService.getUserById(id);
    }
}

// Business logic layer
public class UserService {
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User getUserById(int id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id);
    }
}

// Data access layer
public interface UserRepository {
    User findById(int id);
}

public class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepository {
    @Override
    public User findById(int id) {
        // Code to retrieve user from database
        return null;
    }
}
```

### DTO Example
```java
public class UserDTO {
    private String username;
    private String email;

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture in Java provide a set of effective solutions to the common problems in building enterprise applications. By understanding and implementing these patterns, you can build more robust, maintainable, and scalable applications. Layered architecture, DTOs, the repository pattern, and the service layer are some of the key patterns that can help you organize your code and improve its quality. Additionally, following common practices and best practices such as error handling, transaction management, and unit testing can further enhance the performance and reliability of your applications.
