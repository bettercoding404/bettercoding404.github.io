description: "
In Java, the `wait()` and `notify()` mechanisms are fundamental concurrency tools provided by the `Object` class. These methods play a crucial role in coordinating the execution of multiple threads, allowing them to communicate and synchronize with each other effectively. By using `wait()` and `notify()`, developers can solve complex problems related to thread - safe resource sharing, producer - consumer scenarios, and more. This blog post will take an in - depth look at these mechanisms, including their fundamental concepts, usage methods, common practices, and best practices.

## 1. Fundamental Concepts

### 1.1 `wait()` Method
The `wait()` method is a method of the `Object` class. When a thread calls the `wait()` method on an object, it releases the lock it holds on that object and enters the waiting state. The thread will remain in this state until another thread calls the `notify()` or `notifyAll()` method on the same object. 

There are three overloaded versions of the `wait()` method:
- `wait()`: The thread will wait indefinitely until it is notified.
- `wait(long timeout)`: The thread will wait for the specified number of milliseconds. If it is not notified within this time, it will wake up automatically.
- `wait(long timeout, int nanos)`: Similar to `wait(long timeout)`, but with more precise time control.

### 1.2 `notify()` and `notifyAll()` Methods
- `notify()`: When a thread calls the `notify()` method on an object, it wakes up one of the threads that are waiting on that object. The choice of which thread to wake up is non - deterministic.
- `notifyAll()`: This method wakes up all the threads that are waiting on the object. All the awakened threads will then compete for the lock on the object.

### 1.3 Monitor and Lock
In Java, every object has an associated monitor (also known as a lock). When a thread enters a synchronized block or method, it acquires the lock on the object. Only one thread can hold the lock at a time. The `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods can only be called from within a synchronized block or method because they operate on the object's monitor.

## 2. Usage Methods

### 2.1 Basic Syntax
Here is a simple example to demonstrate the basic usage of `wait()` and `notify()`:

```java
class SharedObject {
    private boolean flag = false;

    public synchronized void waitForFlag() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!flag) {
            wait();
        }
        System.out.println("Flag is set, proceeding...");
    }

    public synchronized void setFlag() {
        flag = true;
        notify();
    }
}

public class WaitNotifyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedObject shared = new SharedObject();

        Thread waitingThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                shared.waitForFlag();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        Thread notifyingThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
            shared.setFlag();
        });

        waitingThread.start();
        notifyingThread.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `waitingThread` calls the `waitForFlag()` method, which checks the `flag` variable. If the `flag` is `false`, the thread calls `wait()` and enters the waiting state. The `notifyingThread` sleeps for 2 seconds and then calls the `setFlag()` method, which sets the `flag` to `true` and calls `notify()` to wake up the waiting thread.

## 3. Common Practices

### 3.1 Producer - Consumer Pattern
The producer - consumer pattern is a classic use case for the `wait()` and `notify()` mechanisms. In this pattern, producers generate data and put it into a shared buffer, while consumers take data from the buffer. Here is an example:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class Buffer {
    private Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    private static final int MAX_SIZE = 5;

    public synchronized void produce(int item) throws InterruptedException {
        while (queue.size() == MAX_SIZE) {
            wait();
        }
        queue.add(item);
        System.out.println("Produced: " + item);
        notifyAll();
    }

    public synchronized int consume() throws InterruptedException {
        while (queue.isEmpty()) {
            wait();
        }
        int item = queue.poll();
        System.out.println("Consumed: " + item);
        notifyAll();
        return item;
    }
}

public class ProducerConsumerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Buffer buffer = new Buffer();

        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    buffer.produce(i);
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    buffer.consume();
                    Thread.sleep(200);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `produce()` method checks if the buffer is full. If it is, the producer thread calls `wait()`. After adding an item to the buffer, it calls `notifyAll()` to wake up any waiting consumer threads. The `consume()` method checks if the buffer is empty. If it is, the consumer thread calls `wait()`. After consuming an item, it calls `notifyAll()` to wake up any waiting producer threads.

## 4. Best Practices

### 4.1 Always Use `while` Loop with `wait()`
It is recommended to use a `while` loop around the `wait()` call instead of an `if` statement. This is because of the possibility of spurious wakeups. A spurious wakeup occurs when a thread wakes up from the `wait()` method without being notified. By using a `while` loop, the thread will re - check the condition after waking up.

### 4.2 Use `notifyAll()` Sparingly
While `notifyAll()` can be useful in some cases, it can also cause unnecessary wake - ups and resource consumption. If possible, use `notify()` to wake up only one thread.

### 4.3 Handle `InterruptedException` Properly
The `wait()` method throws `InterruptedException`. It is important to handle this exception properly. Usually, the best practice is to restore the interrupted status of the thread by calling `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()`.

## 5. Conclusion
Java's `wait()` and `notify()` mechanisms are powerful tools for thread synchronization and communication. They allow multiple threads to coordinate their actions and share resources safely. However, they should be used with care. Understanding the fundamental concepts, following the correct usage methods, and applying best practices can help developers write more robust and efficient concurrent Java programs.
