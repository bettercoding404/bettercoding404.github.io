## Fundamental Concepts

### Java MultiThreading
Java multithreading is a fundamental feature that allows multiple threads to execute concurrently within a single Java program. A thread is an independent path of execution within a process. By creating and managing multiple threads, a Java application can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, taking advantage of multi - core processors to improve performance. Java provides several ways to create and manage threads, such as extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.

### Parallel Streams
Parallel streams are a feature introduced in Java 8 as part of the Stream API. A stream is a sequence of elements supporting various operations, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing. Parallel streams allow these operations to be executed in parallel across multiple threads, leveraging the underlying Fork - Join framework to split the work among multiple threads automatically. This can significantly speed up the processing of large collections.

## Usage Methods

### Java MultiThreading Example
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    private final int id;

    public MyRunnable(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread " + id + " is running.");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Thread " + id + " is finished.");
    }
}

public class MultiThreadingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[5];
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            threads[i] = new Thread(new MyRunnable(i));
            threads[i].start();
        }

        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            try {
                thread.join();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        System.out.println("All threads are finished.");
    }
}
```
In this example, we define a `Runnable` implementation `MyRunnable` and create five threads to execute it. We use the `start()` method to start each thread and the `join()` method to wait for all threads to finish.

### Parallel Streams Example
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class ParallelStreamsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

        int sum = numbers.parallelStream()
               .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
               .sum();

        System.out.println("The sum of the numbers is: " + sum);
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a list of integers and use the `parallelStream()` method to create a parallel stream. Then we perform a mapping operation and calculate the sum of the elements in parallel.

## Common Practices

### Java MultiThreading Common Practices
- **Thread Pooling**: Instead of creating a new thread for each task, use a thread pool. The `ExecutorService` interface in Java provides a convenient way to manage a pool of threads. For example:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class MyTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task is running.");
    }
}

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            executor.submit(new MyTask());
        }
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
- **Synchronization**: When multiple threads access shared resources, use synchronization mechanisms such as `synchronized` blocks or `Lock` interfaces to prevent race conditions.

### Parallel Streams Common Practices
- **Large Data Sets**: Use parallel streams when processing large data sets. The overhead of parallelization is usually worth it when dealing with a large number of elements.
- **Stateless Operations**: Ensure that the operations performed on the stream are stateless. Stateful operations can lead to unpredictable results in parallel streams.

## Best Practices

### Java MultiThreading Best Practices
- **Avoid Deadlocks**: Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources. To avoid deadlocks, use consistent locking order and limit the scope of locks.
- **Proper Error Handling**: Each thread should have its own error - handling mechanism to prevent uncaught exceptions from crashing the entire application.

### Parallel Streams Best Practices
- **Measure Performance**: Before using parallel streams, measure the performance of both sequential and parallel streams on your data set. Sometimes, parallel streams may not provide a performance improvement due to the overhead of parallelization.
- **Limit Parallelism**: You can limit the level of parallelism in parallel streams by setting the `java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism` system property.

## Comparison
- **Complexity**: Java multithreading is more complex to use as it requires manual management of threads, synchronization, and thread pools. Parallel streams, on the other hand, are easier to use as the underlying Fork - Join framework takes care of most of the parallelization details.
- **Flexibility**: Java multithreading provides more flexibility as you have full control over the creation, management, and synchronization of threads. Parallel streams are more suitable for simple data processing tasks.
- **Performance**: For large data sets and CPU - intensive tasks, parallel streams can provide significant performance improvements. However, for small data sets or tasks with a lot of I/O operations, the overhead of parallelization in parallel streams may outweigh the benefits.

## Conclusion
Both Java multithreading and parallel streams are powerful tools for achieving concurrency in Java. Java multithreading is more suitable for complex scenarios where fine - grained control over threads is required, such as implementing custom thread pools and handling complex synchronization requirements. Parallel streams, on the other hand, are a great choice for simple data processing tasks on large data sets, as they provide an easy - to - use and efficient way to parallelize operations. When choosing between them, consider the complexity of your task, the size of your data set, and the performance requirements of your application.
