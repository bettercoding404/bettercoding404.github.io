Java multithreading allows developers to execute multiple threads concurrently, which can significantly enhance the performance and responsiveness of an application. However, working with multithreading is not without its challenges. There are several common pitfalls that, if not addressed, can lead to bugs that are difficult to debug, such as race conditions, deadlocks, and resource starvation. This blog aims to guide you through the fundamental concepts of Java multithreading, and show you how to avoid these common pitfalls through usage methods, common practices, and best practices.

## Fundamental Concepts of Java MultiThreading
### Thread
A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a program. In Java, a thread can be created by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.

```java
// Extending the Thread class
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

// Implementing the Runnable interface
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running runnable: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();

        Thread runnableThread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        runnableThread.start();
    }
}
```

### Synchronization
Synchronization is a mechanism in Java that is used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads. It ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class SynchronizationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls in Java MultiThreading
### Race Conditions
A race condition occurs when multiple threads access and manipulate shared data concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the relative timing of their execution.

```java
class RaceConditionExample {
    private static int sharedVariable = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                sharedVariable++;
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                sharedVariable++;
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final value of sharedVariable: " + sharedVariable);
    }
}
```
In this example, the final value of `sharedVariable` may not be 2000 due to race conditions.

### Deadlocks
A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource.

```java
class DeadlockExample {
    private static final Object resource1 = new Object();
    private static final Object resource2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (resource1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding resource 1...");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Waiting for resource 2...");
                synchronized (resource2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding resource 1 and 2...");
                }
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (resource2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding resource 2...");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Waiting for resource 1...");
                synchronized (resource1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding resource 1 and 2...");
                }
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
In this example, both threads may end up waiting for each other indefinitely, resulting in a deadlock.

### Resource Starvation
Resource starvation occurs when a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress.

## Usage Methods to Avoid Pitfalls
### Use Synchronization Properly
As shown in the synchronization example above, using the `synchronized` keyword can help prevent race conditions. You can synchronize methods or blocks of code to ensure that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time.

### Avoid Nested Synchronization
Nested synchronization can increase the risk of deadlocks. Try to keep synchronization simple and avoid locking multiple resources in different orders in different threads.

### Use Thread-safe Data Structures
Java provides many thread-safe data structures such as `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, etc. These data structures are designed to be used in a multithreaded environment without the need for external synchronization.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class ThreadSafeDataStructureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                map.put("key" + i, i);
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                map.put("key" + i, i * 2);
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

## Common Practices and Best Practices
### Use Executor Framework
The Executor framework in Java provides a high - level interface for managing threads. It allows you to create thread pools and submit tasks to them.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ExecutorFrameworkExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        executor.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task 1 is running on thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });

        executor.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task 2 is running on thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Use `volatile` Keyword
The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to mark a variable as "being stored in main memory". Any read or write operation on a `volatile` variable will be directly from/to the main memory, which can help prevent visibility issues.

```java
class VolatileExample {
    private static volatile boolean flag = false;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            while (!flag) {
                // Do some work
            }
            System.out.println("Thread 1: Flag is now true.");
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            flag = true;
            System.out.println("Thread 2: Set flag to true.");
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Java multithreading can be a powerful tool for improving the performance and responsiveness of applications, but it comes with its own set of challenges. By understanding the fundamental concepts, being aware of common pitfalls such as race conditions, deadlocks, and resource starvation, and following best practices like using synchronization properly, thread-safe data structures, the executor framework, and the `volatile` keyword, developers can write robust and reliable multithreaded Java applications.
