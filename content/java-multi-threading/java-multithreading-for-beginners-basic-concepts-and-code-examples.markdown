## Fundamental Concepts of Java Multi - Threading
### Thread
A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a program. In Java, a thread can be thought of as an independent path of execution within a process. Each thread has its own call stack, program counter, and local variables. A Java program can have multiple threads running concurrently, which means that different parts of the program can execute at the same time.

### Process
A process is a program in execution. It can contain one or more threads. For example, when you run a Java application, it is a process, and it can have multiple threads working together to perform different tasks.

### Concurrency vs. Parallelism
- **Concurrency**: Concurrency is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time. In a concurrent system, the tasks are interleaved in time, which means that the CPU switches between different tasks very quickly. Java multi - threading provides concurrency by allowing multiple threads to share the CPU resources.
- **Parallelism**: Parallelism is the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. This requires multiple CPU cores or processors. While concurrency can be achieved on a single - core CPU, parallelism requires a multi - core CPU.

### Thread States
In Java, a thread can be in one of the following states:
- **New**: A thread is in the new state when it is created but not yet started.
- **Runnable**: A thread is in the runnable state when it has been started and is ready to run. It is waiting for the CPU to allocate time to it.
- **Blocked**: A thread is in the blocked state when it is waiting for a monitor lock to enter a synchronized block or method.
- **Waiting**: A thread is in the waiting state when it is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
- **Timed Waiting**: A thread is in the timed waiting state when it is waiting for a specified amount of time.
- **Terminated**: A thread is in the terminated state when it has completed its execution.

## Usage Methods
### Extending the `Thread` Class
The first way to create a thread in Java is by extending the `Thread` class. You need to override the `run()` method, which contains the code that will be executed by the thread. Here is the basic syntax:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed by the thread
        System.out.println("This is a thread created by extending Thread class.");
    }
}
```
To start the thread, you need to create an instance of the `MyThread` class and call the `start()` method:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

### Implementing the `Runnable` Interface
The second way to create a thread is by implementing the `Runnable` interface. You need to implement the `run()` method in the class that implements the `Runnable` interface. Here is the basic syntax:
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed by the thread
        System.out.println("This is a thread created by implementing Runnable interface.");
    }
}
```
To start the thread, you need to create an instance of the `MyRunnable` class and pass it to the `Thread` class constructor, and then call the `start()` method:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

## Common Practices
### Synchronization
When multiple threads access shared resources, there is a risk of data inconsistency. Synchronization is used to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. In Java, you can use the `synchronized` keyword to achieve synchronization. Here is an example:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `increment()` method is synchronized, which means that only one thread can call this method at a time.

### Thread Joining
The `join()` method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. This is useful when you want to ensure that one thread has finished its task before another thread starts. Here is an example:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Thread has finished its execution.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();
        try {
            thread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Main thread can continue now.");
    }
}
```

## Best Practices
### Use the `ExecutorService` Framework
The `ExecutorService` framework in Java provides a high - level way to manage threads. It allows you to create a pool of threads and submit tasks to them. This is more efficient than creating and managing threads manually. Here is an example:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class MyTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task is being executed by a thread from the pool.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            executor.submit(new MyTask());
        }
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Avoid Using `stop()`, `suspend()`, and `resume()`
The `stop()`, `suspend()` and `resume()` methods in the `Thread` class are deprecated because they can lead to inconsistent states in the program. Instead, use other mechanisms such as flags to control the execution of a thread.

### Handle Exceptions Properly
When working with threads, it is important to handle exceptions properly. Unhandled exceptions in a thread can cause the thread to terminate unexpectedly. You can use try - catch blocks in the `run()` method to handle exceptions.

## Code Examples
### Example 1: Multiple Threads Printing Messages
```java
class MessagePrinter implements Runnable {
    private String message;

    public MessagePrinter(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(message);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MessagePrinter("Hello"));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MessagePrinter("World"));
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Using `ExecutorService`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class Task implements Runnable {
    private int taskId;

    public Task(int taskId) {
        this.taskId = taskId;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is being executed.");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " has completed.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Task(i));
        }
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
