description: "
Java multithreading is a powerful feature that allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently. This can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of applications, especially those dealing with I/O operations or complex computations. In this blog, we will start from the basics of creating and managing threads in Java and gradually move towards more advanced concepts like `CompletableFutures`, which provide a more convenient and flexible way to handle asynchronous operations.

## Fundamental Concepts of Java MultiThreading
### Thread
A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a program. In Java, a thread is represented by the `Thread` class. Each thread has its own call stack and can execute code independently.

### Concurrency vs Parallelism
- **Concurrency**: It is the ability of a program to handle multiple tasks at the same time, but not necessarily executing them simultaneously. For example, a single-core CPU can switch between multiple threads to give the illusion of concurrent execution.
- **Parallelism**: It refers to the actual simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. This requires multiple CPU cores.

### Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming allows a program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for a particular task to complete. This is useful for I/O-bound operations where the program would otherwise be blocked.

## Creating and Managing Threads
### Extending the Thread Class
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();
    }
}
```
### Implementing the Runnable Interface
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

## Synchronization and Thread Safety
When multiple threads access shared resources, there is a risk of data inconsistency. Synchronization is used to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

### Synchronized Methods
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class SynchronizedExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

## Executor Service
The `ExecutorService` is a higher-level abstraction for managing threads. It provides a pool of threads and allows you to submit tasks for execution.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ExecutorServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        executorService.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task 1 is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });

        executorService.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task 2 is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });

        executorService.shutdown();
    }
}
```

## CompletableFutures
`CompletableFuture` is a class introduced in Java 8 that provides a more convenient way to handle asynchronous operations. It allows you to chain multiple asynchronous tasks and handle the results in a more functional way.

### Basic Usage
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            return "Hello, World!";
        });

        String result = future.get();
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

### Chaining CompletableFutures
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;

public class CompletableFutureChainingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            return "Hello";
        }).thenApply(s -> s + ", World!");

        String result = future.get();
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

## Common Practices and Best Practices
- **Use Thread Pools**: Instead of creating threads manually, use thread pools provided by the `ExecutorService` to manage resources efficiently.
- **Avoid Deadlocks**: Make sure to use synchronization carefully to avoid deadlocks, where two or more threads are blocked forever waiting for each other.
- **Handle Exceptions Properly**: When using `CompletableFutures`, handle exceptions using methods like `exceptionally` or `handle` to prevent unexpected behavior.
- **Use CompletableFutures for Asynchronous Operations**: For complex asynchronous tasks, `CompletableFutures` provide a more readable and maintainable way to handle the results.

## Conclusion
Java multithreading is a powerful feature that can greatly enhance the performance and responsiveness of applications. Starting from basic thread creation and management, we have explored more advanced concepts like `CompletableFutures`. By understanding these concepts and following best practices, you can write more efficient and reliable multithreaded Java programs.
