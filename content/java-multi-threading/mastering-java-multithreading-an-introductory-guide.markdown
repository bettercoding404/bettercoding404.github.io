## Fundamental Concepts of Java MultiThreading
### Thread
A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a program. In Java, a thread is an instance of the `Thread` class or a class that extends the `Thread` class or implements the `Runnable` interface. Each thread has its own call stack, program counter, and local variables.

### Concurrency vs Parallelism
- **Concurrency**: Concurrency is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time, but not necessarily executing them simultaneously. It is achieved through time slicing, where the CPU switches between different tasks very quickly.
- **Parallelism**: Parallelism is the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. It requires multiple CPU cores or processors.

### Thread States
In Java, a thread can be in one of the following states:
- **New**: A thread is in the new state when it is created but not yet started.
- **Runnable**: A thread is in the runnable state when it is started and is waiting to be assigned to a CPU.
- **Running**: A thread is in the running state when it is currently being executed by the CPU.
- **Blocked**: A thread is in the blocked state when it is waiting for a monitor lock to enter a synchronized block or method.
- **Waiting**: A thread is in the waiting state when it is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action.
- **Timed Waiting**: A thread is in the timed waiting state when it is waiting for a specified amount of time.
- **Terminated**: A thread is in the terminated state when it has completed its execution.

## Usage Methods of Java MultiThreading
### Extending the Thread Class
The first way to create a thread in Java is by extending the `Thread` class. Here is an example:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a class `MyThread` that extends the `Thread` class and overrides the `run()` method. The `run()` method contains the code that will be executed by the thread. We then create two instances of `MyThread` and start them using the `start()` method.

### Implementing the Runnable Interface
The second way to create a thread in Java is by implementing the `Runnable` interface. Here is an example:
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(myRunnable);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(myRunnable);

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a class `MyRunnable` that implements the `Runnable` interface and overrides the `run()` method. We then create an instance of `MyRunnable` and pass it to the `Thread` constructor to create two threads. Finally, we start the threads using the `start()` method.

### Using the Executor Framework
The Executor framework is a high-level API in Java that simplifies the management of threads. It provides a thread pool that can be used to execute multiple tasks concurrently. Here is an example:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class MyTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class ExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        MyTask task = new MyTask();

        executor.submit(task);
        executor.submit(task);

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a class `MyTask` that implements the `Runnable` interface. We then create an executor service with a fixed thread pool of size 2. We submit two tasks to the executor service and finally shut down the executor service.

## Common Practices in Java MultiThreading
### Synchronization
Synchronization is used to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. In Java, we can use the `synchronized` keyword to create synchronized blocks or methods. Here is an example:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

class IncrementTask implements Runnable {
    private Counter counter;

    public IncrementTask(Counter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            counter.increment();
        }
    }
}

public class SynchronizationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        IncrementTask task = new IncrementTask(counter);

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task);

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();

        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a class `Counter` with a synchronized method `increment()`. We then create a class `IncrementTask` that implements the `Runnable` interface and uses the `Counter` object. We create two threads and start them. Finally, we wait for the threads to complete using the `join()` method and print the count.

### Thread Communication
Thread communication is used to allow threads to communicate with each other. In Java, we can use the `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods to achieve thread communication. Here is an example:
```java
class Message {
    private String msg;
    private boolean empty = true;

    public synchronized String read() {
        while (empty) {
            try {
                wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        empty = true;
        notifyAll();
        return msg;
    }

    public synchronized void write(String msg) {
        while (!empty) {
            try {
                wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        empty = false;
        this.msg = msg;
        notifyAll();
    }
}

class Reader implements Runnable {
    private Message message;

    public Reader(Message message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (String msg = message.read(); !"Finished".equals(msg); msg = message.read()) {
            System.out.println("Reader read: " + msg);
        }
    }
}

class Writer implements Runnable {
    private Message message;

    public Writer(Message message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        String[] messages = {"Hello", "World", "Finished"};
        for (String msg : messages) {
            message.write(msg);
            System.out.println("Writer wrote: " + msg);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadCommunicationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Message message = new Message();
        Thread readerThread = new Thread(new Reader(message));
        Thread writerThread = new Thread(new Writer(message));

        readerThread.start();
        writerThread.start();
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a class `Message` with two synchronized methods `read()` and `write()`. The `read()` method waits until there is a message to read, and the `write()` method waits until the message has been read. We then create a `Reader` and a `Writer` class that implement the `Runnable` interface and use the `Message` object. Finally, we create two threads and start them.

## Best Practices in Java MultiThreading
### Use Thread Pools
Using thread pools can help manage the number of threads in an application and reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads. The Executor framework provides several types of thread pools, such as fixed thread pools, cached thread pools, and single-threaded executors.

### Avoid Synchronization as Much as Possible
Synchronization can introduce performance overhead and can lead to deadlocks if not used correctly. Try to use thread-safe data structures and algorithms that do not require synchronization.

### Handle Exceptions Properly
Exceptions in threads can cause the thread to terminate unexpectedly. Make sure to handle exceptions properly in the `run()` method of the thread.

### Use Atomic Variables
Atomic variables are thread-safe variables that can be used to perform atomic operations without the need for synchronization. Java provides several atomic classes, such as `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, and `AtomicBoolean`.
