## Fundamental Concepts

### Thread Basics
In Java, a thread is an independent path of execution within a program. Threads allow multiple tasks to run concurrently, sharing the same memory space. You can create a thread by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.
```java
// Implementing Runnable interface
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in a thread");
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

### Synchronization and Locking
Synchronization is used to control access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment. Java provides the `synchronized` keyword to achieve this. When a method or block is declared as `synchronized`, only one thread can execute it at a time.
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Thread Pools
Thread pools manage a group of worker threads. Instead of creating a new thread for each task, a thread from the pool is assigned to execute the task. This reduces the overhead of thread creation and destruction.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task executed by thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

## Usage Methods

### Measuring Performance
To tune the performance of a multithreaded application, you first need to measure it. You can use simple techniques like measuring the execution time of a block of code.
```java
long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
// Your multithreaded code here
long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ms");
```

### Profiling Tools
Java provides several profiling tools such as VisualVM and YourKit. These tools can help you identify performance bottlenecks, monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, and thread activity.

## Common Practices

### Reducing Lock Contention
Lock contention occurs when multiple threads try to acquire the same lock simultaneously. You can reduce it by minimizing the scope of the lock and using fine - grained locking.
```java
class FineGrainedLockingExample {
    private Object lock1 = new Object();
    private Object lock2 = new Object();
    private int value1 = 0;
    private int value2 = 0;

    public void incrementValue1() {
        synchronized (lock1) {
            value1++;
        }
    }

    public void incrementValue2() {
        synchronized (lock2) {
            value2++;
        }
    }
}
```

### Using Non - blocking Algorithms
Non - blocking algorithms use atomic variables and compare - and - swap (CAS) operations to achieve concurrency without using locks. Java's `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package provides atomic classes.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class NonBlockingCounter {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet();
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count.get();
    }
}
```

### Optimizing Thread Pool Sizes
The optimal thread pool size depends on the nature of the tasks. For CPU - bound tasks, the number of threads should be close to the number of available CPU cores. For I/O - bound tasks, a larger number of threads can be used.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class OptimizedThreadPool {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int coreCount = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(coreCount);
        // Submit tasks
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Avoiding Deadlocks
Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. You can avoid deadlocks by acquiring locks in a consistent order and using timeout mechanisms.
```java
class DeadlockAvoidance {
    private Object lock1 = new Object();
    private Object lock2 = new Object();

    public void method1() {
        synchronized (lock1) {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            synchronized (lock2) {
                // Do something
            }
        }
    }

    public void method2() {
        synchronized (lock1) {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                // Do something
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Using Immutable Objects
Immutable objects are thread - safe because their state cannot be changed after creation. This eliminates the need for synchronization.
```java
final class ImmutableClass {
    private final int value;

    public ImmutableClass(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public int getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

### Resource Management
Proper resource management is crucial in multithreaded applications. Make sure to close resources such as files, sockets, and database connections in a timely manner.

## Code Examples
Here is a more comprehensive example that combines some of the concepts discussed above:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class Task implements Runnable {
    private static AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

    @Override
    public void run() {
        counter.incrementAndGet();
        System.out.println("Task " + counter.get() + " executed by thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class ComprehensiveExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int coreCount = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(coreCount);
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Task());
        }
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Performance tuning of Java multithreaded applications is a complex but rewarding task. By understanding the fundamental concepts, using the right usage methods, following common and best practices, and applying the techniques in real - world code examples, you can significantly improve the performance of your multithreaded applications. Remember to measure, profile, and continuously optimize your code to achieve the best results.
