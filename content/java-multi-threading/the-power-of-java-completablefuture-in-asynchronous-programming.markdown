## Fundamental Concepts
A `CompletableFuture` in Java represents a future result of an asynchronous computation. It can be thought of as a container that will eventually hold a value when the computation is completed. The key idea behind `CompletableFuture` is that it allows you to perform operations on the result once it becomes available, without blocking the current thread. 

Asynchronous operations are executed in a separate thread, typically from a thread pool. This enables the main thread to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to finish. `CompletableFuture` also supports chaining of operations, which means you can define a sequence of actions to be performed on the result as it becomes available.

## Usage Methods

### Creating a CompletableFuture
There are several ways to create a `CompletableFuture`:

#### Using `CompletableFuture.runAsync()`
This method is used when you have a task that does not return a result. It takes a `Runnable` as an argument.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
                System.out.println("Task completed");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }, executor);
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

#### Using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()`
This method is used when your task returns a result. It takes a `Supplier` as an argument.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class CompletableFutureSupplyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
                return "Result from asynchronous task";
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
                return null;
            }
        }, executor);
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Chaining Operations
You can chain operations on a `CompletableFuture` using methods like `thenApply()`, `thenAccept()`, and `thenRun()`.

#### `thenApply()`
This method takes a `Function` and applies it to the result of the `CompletableFuture` when it becomes available.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class ThenApplyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
               .thenApply(s -> s + " World");
        future.thenAccept(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

#### `thenAccept()`
This method takes a `Consumer` and consumes the result of the `CompletableFuture` when it becomes available.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class ThenAcceptExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
               .thenAccept(s -> System.out.println("Received: " + s));
    }
}
```

#### `thenRun()`
This method takes a `Runnable` and runs it when the `CompletableFuture` is completed.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class ThenRunExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
               .thenRun(() -> System.out.println("Task finished"));
    }
}
```

### Combining CompletableFutures
You can combine multiple `CompletableFutures` using methods like `thenCombine()` and `thenCompose()`.

#### `thenCombine()`
This method combines the results of two `CompletableFutures` using a `BiFunction`.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class ThenCombineExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<String> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello");
        CompletableFuture<String> future2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> " World");
        CompletableFuture<String> combinedFuture = future1.thenCombine(future2, (s1, s2) -> s1 + s2);
        combinedFuture.thenAccept(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

#### `thenCompose()`
This method is used when you have a `CompletableFuture` that returns another `CompletableFuture`.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class ThenComposeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<CompletableFuture<String>> nestedFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello World");
        });
        CompletableFuture<String> flatFuture = nestedFuture.thenCompose(f -> f);
        flatFuture.thenAccept(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

## Common Practices

### Parallel Task Execution
You can use `CompletableFuture` to execute multiple tasks in parallel and wait for all of them to complete.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ParallelTaskExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        CompletableFuture<String> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
                return "Result 1";
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
                return null;
            }
        }, executor);
        CompletableFuture<String> future2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(3000);
                return "Result 2";
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
                return null;
            }
        }, executor);
        CompletableFuture<Void> allFutures = CompletableFuture.allOf(future1, future2);
        CompletableFuture<String> combinedResult = allFutures.thenApply(v -> {
            return future1.join() + " " + future2.join();
        });
        combinedResult.thenAccept(System.out::println);
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Error Handling
You can handle errors in a `CompletableFuture` using the `exceptionally()` method.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class ErrorHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            throw new RuntimeException("Error occurred");
        }).exceptionally(ex -> {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + ex.getMessage());
            return "Default value";
        });
        future.thenAccept(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

## Best Practices
- **Use Custom Thread Pools**: When using `CompletableFuture`, it is recommended to use custom thread pools instead of relying on the common fork - join pool. This gives you more control over the number of threads and their behavior.
- **Proper Error Handling**: Always handle exceptions in your `CompletableFuture` chains to prevent unexpected failures. Use methods like `exceptionally()`, `handle()`, and `whenComplete()` for error handling.
- **Limit Nested Futures**: Avoid creating deeply nested `CompletableFutures` as it can make the code hard to read and maintain. Use `thenCompose()` to flatten nested futures.
- **Close Thread Pools**: If you are using a custom thread pool, make sure to shut it down properly to release system resources.

## Conclusion
Java's `CompletableFuture` is a powerful and flexible tool for asynchronous programming. It provides a wide range of APIs that allow developers to write complex asynchronous code easily. By understanding the fundamental concepts, usage methods, common practices, and best practices, you can leverage the full potential of `CompletableFuture` to improve the performance and responsiveness of your Java applications.
