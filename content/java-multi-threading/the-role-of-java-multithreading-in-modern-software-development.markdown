## 1. Fundamental Concepts

### Threads in Java
A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a program. In Java, a thread is an instance of the `Thread` class or a class that extends it. Each thread has its own call stack, program counter, and local variables. Java programs start with a single thread called the main thread, and additional threads can be created to perform concurrent tasks.

### Concurrency vs. Parallelism
- **Concurrency**: Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time. It doesn't necessarily mean that tasks are executed simultaneously. In a single - core system, the CPU switches between different tasks rapidly, giving the illusion of concurrent execution.
- **Parallelism**: Parallelism means that multiple tasks are actually executed at the same time. This requires a multi - core processor, where each core can execute a different task simultaneously.

### Thread States
Java threads can be in one of the following states:
- **New**: A newly created thread that has not started yet.
- **Runnable**: A thread that is ready to run and is waiting for the CPU to allocate time.
- **Blocked**: A thread that is waiting for a monitor lock to enter a synchronized block or method.
- **Waiting**: A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
- **Timed Waiting**: A thread that is waiting for a specified period of time.
- **Terminated**: A thread that has completed its execution.


## 2. Usage Methods

### Extending the Thread Class
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a class `MyThread` that extends the `Thread` class and overrides the `run()` method. The `run()` method contains the code that will be executed when the thread starts. We then create two instances of `MyThread` and call the `start()` method to start the threads.

### Implementing the Runnable Interface
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(myRunnable, "Thread 1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(myRunnable, "Thread 2");
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```
Here, we create a class `MyRunnable` that implements the `Runnable` interface and overrides the `run()` method. We then create an instance of `MyRunnable` and pass it to the `Thread` constructor to create two threads.

### Using the Executor Service
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class Task implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running.");
    }
}

public class ExecutorServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Task());
        }
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
The `ExecutorService` is a high - level framework for managing threads. In this example, we create a fixed - size thread pool using `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2)`. We then submit five tasks to the executor service, and finally, we call the `shutdown()` method to gracefully shut down the executor service.


## 3. Common Practices

### Synchronization
When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization is necessary to prevent race conditions. Java provides the `synchronized` keyword to achieve synchronization.
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

class IncrementTask implements Runnable {
    private Counter counter;

    public IncrementTask(Counter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            counter.increment();
        }
    }
}

public class SynchronizationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        IncrementTask task = new IncrementTask(counter);
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task);
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();
        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
In this example, the `increment()` method of the `Counter` class is declared as `synchronized`, which means only one thread can execute this method at a time.

### Thread Communication
Java provides methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` for thread communication.
```java
class ProducerConsumerExample {
    private static final int MAX_SIZE = 5;
    private java.util.LinkedList<Integer> buffer = new java.util.LinkedList<>();

    class Producer implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (true) {
                synchronized (buffer) {
                    while (buffer.size() == MAX_SIZE) {
                        try {
                            buffer.wait();
                        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
                    }
                    int item = (int) (Math.random() * 100);
                    buffer.add(item);
                    System.out.println("Produced: " + item);
                    buffer.notifyAll();
                }
            }
        }
    }

    class Consumer implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (true) {
                synchronized (buffer) {
                    while (buffer.isEmpty()) {
                        try {
                            buffer.wait();
                        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
                    }
                    int item = buffer.poll();
                    System.out.println("Consumed: " + item);
                    buffer.notifyAll();
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProducerConsumerExample example = new ProducerConsumerExample();
        Thread producerThread = new Thread(example.new Producer());
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(example.new Consumer());
        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }
}
```
In this producer - consumer example, the `Producer` thread adds items to the buffer, and the `Consumer` thread removes items from the buffer. The `wait()` method is used to make a thread wait until a certain condition is met, and the `notifyAll()` method is used to wake up all the waiting threads.


## 4. Best Practices

### Avoiding Deadlocks
Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. To avoid deadlocks, follow these guidelines:
- **Acquire locks in a consistent order**: Make sure all threads acquire locks in the same order.
- **Use try - lock**: Instead of using `synchronized` blocks, use `ReentrantLock.tryLock()` to avoid indefinite waiting.

### Resource Management
- **Use thread pools**: Thread pools help in managing the number of threads and reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads.
- **Shut down thread pools properly**: Always call the `shutdown()` or `shutdownNow()` method on the `ExecutorService` to release resources.

### Error Handling
- **Catch exceptions in threads**: Each thread should have its own exception handling mechanism to prevent the entire application from crashing due to an unhandled exception in a single thread.


## 5. Conclusion
Java multithreading is a powerful feature that can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of modern software applications. By understanding the fundamental concepts, using the appropriate usage methods, following common practices, and adhering to best practices, developers can harness the full potential of multithreading in Java. However, multithreading also introduces challenges such as race conditions and deadlocks, which need to be carefully managed. With proper knowledge and careful implementation, Java multithreading can be a valuable asset in software development.
