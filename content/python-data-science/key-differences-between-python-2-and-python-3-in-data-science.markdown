## Fundamental Concept Differences

### Print Function
In Python 2, `print` is a statement, while in Python 3, it is a function.

**Python 2 Example**:
```python
# Python 2
print "Hello, World!"
```

**Python 3 Example**:
```python
# Python 3
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Integer Division
In Python 2, when you divide two integers, the result is also an integer, truncating the decimal part. In Python 3, the division operator `/` performs true division, returning a float.

**Python 2 Example**:
```python
# Python 2
result = 5 / 2
print result  # Output: 2
```

**Python 3 Example**:
```python
# Python 3
result = 5 / 2
print(result)  # Output: 2.5
```

### Unicode Strings
Python 2 has two types of strings: ASCII strings (`str`) and Unicode strings (`unicode`). Python 3 uses Unicode strings by default, and the `str` type represents Unicode strings.

**Python 2 Example**:
```python
# Python 2
ascii_string = 'Hello'
unicode_string = u'你好'
```

**Python 3 Example**:
```python
# Python 3
unicode_string = '你好'
```

### Exception Handling
The syntax for exception handling has a minor difference. In Python 2, you can use the `as` keyword optionally, while in Python 3, it is mandatory.

**Python 2 Example**:
```python
# Python 2
try:
    result = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError, e:
    print "Error:", e
```

**Python 3 Example**:
```python
# Python 3
try:
    result = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

## Usage Method Differences

### Library Compatibility
Many modern data science libraries, such as `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `scikit - learn`, have fully embraced Python 3 and may have limited or no support for Python 2. For example, Python 2 support for `pandas` was officially dropped after version 0.24.

### Syntax Changes
Python 3 introduced some new syntax features that are not available in Python 2. For example, the `yield from` syntax for generators.

```python
# Python 3
def gen1():
    yield 1
    yield 2

def gen2():
    yield from gen1()
    yield 3

for num in gen2():
    print(num)
```

## Common Practices in Python 2 and Python 3 for Data Science

### Data Manipulation
In both Python 2 and Python 3, `pandas` is a popular library for data manipulation. However, with the deprecation of Python 2 support in `pandas`, Python 3 is the recommended choice for new projects.

```python
# Python 3
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

### Data Visualization
`Matplotlib` is a widely used library for data visualization. It supports both Python 2 and Python 3, but Python 3 may offer better performance and compatibility with other modern libraries.

```python
# Python 3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

### Machine Learning
`scikit - learn` is a powerful machine learning library. Python 3 is the preferred version as it ensures compatibility with the latest features and bug fixes.

```python
# Python 3
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.3)

knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
accuracy = knn.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

## Best Practices for Data Scientists
- **Use Python 3 for New Projects**: Given the deprecation of Python 2 and the better support for modern libraries, Python 3 should be the default choice for new data science projects.
- **Migrate Existing Python 2 Code**: If you have existing Python 2 code, plan to migrate it to Python 3 to ensure long - term compatibility and access to the latest features.
- **Test Code Compatibility**: When using third - party libraries, test your code thoroughly to ensure it works correctly in Python 3.

## Conclusion
The differences between Python 2 and Python 3 in data science are significant and can impact various aspects of your projects. While Python 2 was once the standard, Python 3 has become the new norm due to its improved features, better Unicode support, and wider library compatibility. Data scientists should embrace Python 3 for new projects and migrate existing Python 2 code to stay up - to - date with the latest developments in the field.
